# Nextcloud MCP Server

**A production-ready MCP server that connects AI assistants to your Nextcloud instance.**

Enable Large Language Models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini to interact with your Nextcloud data through a secure API. Create notes, manage calendars, organize contacts, work with files, and more - all through natural language conversations.

This is a **dedicated standalone MCP server** designed for external MCP clients like Claude Code and IDEs. It runs independently of Nextcloud (Docker, VM, Kubernetes, or local) and provides deep CRUD operations across Nextcloud apps.

> [!NOTE]
> **Looking for AI features inside Nextcloud?** Nextcloud also provides [Context Agent](https://github.com/nextcloud/context_agent), which powers the Assistant app and runs as an ExApp inside Nextcloud. See [docs/comparison-context-agent.md](docs/comparison-context-agent.md) for a detailed comparison of use cases.

## Quick Start

Run the server locally with [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (no installation required):

```bash
NEXTCLOUD_HOST=https://your.nextcloud.instance.com \
NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=your_username \
NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD=your_app_password \
  uvx nextcloud-mcp-server run --transport stdio
```

Or add it directly to your MCP client configuration (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json` or `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nextcloud": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["nextcloud-mcp-server", "run", "--transport", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "NEXTCLOUD_HOST": "https://your.nextcloud.instance.com",
        "NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD": "your_app_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Generate an [app password](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/session_management.html#managing-devices) in Nextcloud under **Settings > Security > Devices & sessions** instead of using your login password.

## Key Features

- **110+ MCP Tools** - Comprehensive API coverage across 10 Nextcloud apps
- **MCP Resources** - Structured data URIs for browsing Nextcloud data
- **Semantic Search (Experimental)** - Optional vector-powered search for Notes, Files, News items, and Deck cards (requires Qdrant + Ollama)
- **Document Processing** - OCR and text extraction from PDFs, DOCX, images with progress notifications
- **Flexible Deployment** - Docker, Kubernetes, VM, or local installation
- **Production-Ready Auth** - Basic Auth with app passwords; multi-user via Login Flow v2 — MCP clients authenticate via OAuth, the server handles Nextcloud app passwords transparently
- **Tag-Based File Exclusion** - Hide sensitive files/folders from MCP file tools by tagging them with a configured Nextcloud system tag (`EXCLUDED_TAGS`). See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#tag-based-file-exclusion-optional)
- **Multiple Transports** - streamable-http (default) and stdio

## Authentication

The MCP server authenticates to Nextcloud using **app-specific passwords** (Basic Auth). Three deployment modes are supported:

| Mode | Best for |
|------|----------|
| Single-User (BasicAuth) | Personal use, development, single-user deployments |
| Multi-User (BasicAuth pass-through) | Multi-user setups where clients send credentials via Authorization header |
| Multi-User (Login Flow v2) | Multi-user / hosted deployments — clients authenticate to the MCP server via OAuth, and the server obtains a per-user app password from Nextcloud and uses it transparently |

OAuth-direct-to-Nextcloud is no longer supported (it required upstream patches to `user_oidc` that were never merged). Login Flow v2 replaces it for multi-user deployments and works with stock Nextcloud.

See [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md) for setup instructions.

## Semantic Search

An experimental RAG pipeline that lets MCP clients find Nextcloud content by **meaning** rather than keywords — a query for "car" also surfaces notes about "vehicle" or "transportation". Disabled by default (`ENABLE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH=false`); requires a vector database and embedding service. See [docs/semantic-search-architecture.md](docs/semantic-search-architecture.md) and [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
