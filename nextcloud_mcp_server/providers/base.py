        it ignore the parameter *silently* and return the model's full width with
        no error — measured 2026-08-15 against the astrolabe embedding gateway on

        Letting a mismatch through would size the Qdrant collection from a name
        claiming one width while it holds another, and bill the full vector RAM

        still legible, rather than surfacing as a dimension error at first upsert
        three layers away.

        The check runs on EVERY embed, not only the one that first resolves the

        does not: a backend that changes width mid-run — a failover to a

        mixing widths within a single collection.
