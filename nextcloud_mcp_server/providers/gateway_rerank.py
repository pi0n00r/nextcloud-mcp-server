"""Cross-encoder reranking against the embedding gateway's ``/v1/rerank``.

A plain-httpx sub-client rather than a :class:`~.base.Provider`: the ``Provider``
ABC is an embedding contract (``embed``/``embed_batch``/``get_dimension``) and a
reranker satisfies none of it. Mirrors :mod:`.gateway_batch`, which is the
existing precedent for a gateway surface that is not an embedding provider.

The gateway takes a namespaced model id, so choosing a self-hosted versus a
hosted reranker is configuration rather than a code path here.

# Two independent reasons, both real:

#      "pool size x chunk size" is an unbounded request body. At a large chunk
#      size a full pool exceeds a typical 1 MB ingress limit and fails as a 413
#      from the proxy, not as anything the gateway ever sees.
#   2. Cross-encoders truncate their input near the model's sequence limit
#      anyway, so text beyond roughly this length is not scored — trimming it
#      costs no ranking quality and buys proportional latency.
