"""Client for the embedding gateway's async **batch OCR** routes (Deck #332).

The gateway exposes two batch routes alongside the synchronous ``POST /v1/ocr``
(OCR gateway):

- ``POST /v1/ocr/batch`` — submit N documents (each with a caller ``custom_id``)
  as one Mistral Batch job; returns ``202`` + a namespaced ``job_id``
  (``<provider>/<batch_job_id>``).
- ``GET /v1/ocr/batch/{job_id}`` — poll; returns the lifecycle status and, once
  terminal, per-document results (per-page markdown, or a per-document error).

The gateway is a **stateless passthrough** to Mistral's Batch API — the
``job_id`` is the only handle, so the worker persists it (see
``vector/batch_ocr_store``) and re-polls across procrastinate retries.

This client submits exactly **one document per job** (the v1 unit; coalescing N
docs/job is a follow-up). Auth + ``/v1`` base-url handling mirror the synchronous
:class:`~nextcloud_mcp_server.providers.gateway.GatewayProvider` /
``_GatewayOcrBackend`` — same M2M :class:`GatewayTokenProvider` bearer, no
provider keys in the pod.
