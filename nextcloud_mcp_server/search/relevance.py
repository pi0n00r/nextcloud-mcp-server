"""A [0, 1] relevance value on every search result (ADR-034).

Search returns three mutually incomparable numbers depending on how it ran — a
cosine similarity, a Qdrant RRF fused score bounded by ``2/k`` (~0.033 at the
default k=60), or a cross-encoder score. None of them can be shown to a user:
rendering a fused 0.033 as "3%" is what this module exists to stop, because at
k=60 that is 99% of the maximum achievable score, i.e. a near-perfect hit.

So every result carries ``relevance``, always in [0, 1], mapped from whichever
signal actually produced the ordering, plus a ``relevance_source`` saying which
mapping was used and — crucially — whether the number is a calibrated
probability or only an ordinal.

**The mappings are constants in this file, not configuration.** Cut-points an
operator has to tune are how you get a number whose meaning differs per
deployment, which defeats the point of showing one at all.

## Why two tiers, and why only one of them claims to be a probability

Measured on a 60-query labelled set (1200 (query, document) pairs, note 464925),
fitting each curve on the document-granularity pool and testing it on the
*chunk* pool — a genuine transfer test across a different retrieval shape and a
different prevalence (0.178 -> 0.274), not cross-validation:

| signal | in-sample ECE | transfer ECE | Brier vs always-base-rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| cross-encoder | 0.0414 | 0.0687 | 0.1662 vs 0.1990 (beats it) |
| RRF fusion | 0.0299 | 0.1142 | 0.1940 vs 0.1990 (barely) |

The cross-encoder curve degrades under the shift but survives: it still beats
the base rate, and the property that makes a filter useful — the spread of the
top-scoring row across queries — transfers intact (sd 0.305 -> 0.319).

The fusion curve does NOT survive. Its ECE quadruples, its Brier is level with
predicting the corpus base rate for everything, and its "0-10%" bucket actually
contained 19.3% relevant documents on the transfer set. That is expected rather
than surprising: an RRF score is an artifact of *rank*, so its relationship to
relevance is a property of the population it was fitted on, while a
cross-encoder score is computed from the query and the document themselves.

Hence: the cross-encoder tier reports a **calibrated probability**; the fusion
tier reports an **ordinal** in [0, 1] that orders results honestly and is not a
probability. Both are [0, 1] and filterable; only one may be rendered as a
percentage.

## What this does not do

* **It is not corpus-independent.** Every curve was fitted at prevalence 0.178
  on an OHR-Bench-derived corpus. On a corpus where relevant documents are much
  rarer, a displayed 0.70 overstates; where they are commoner, it understates.
  Ordering is unaffected — the mapping is monotone — so this shifts the number,
  never the ranking. ``fit_base_rate`` is published on every curve so a caller
  can reason about the direction. Correcting it without per-deployment labels is
  possible (SLD/EM prior correction) and is deliberately left to a follow-up.
* **It cannot abstain.** No per-result number answers "does this corpus contain
  an answer at all": on 15/15 deliberately unanswerable probes the top hit
  scored at or above the weakest answerable query's top hit. A high
  ``relevance`` means "best of what was retrieved", not "the answer is here".
