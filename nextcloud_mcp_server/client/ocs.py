"""Shared handling for Nextcloud's OCS response envelope.

Every OCS endpoint wraps its payload the same way::

    {"ocs": {"meta": {"status": "ok", "statuscode": 200, "message": "OK"},
             "data": {...}}}

Two properties of that envelope bite callers who only check the HTTP status:

* **The v1 trap.** ``/ocs/v1.php`` answers *every* request with HTTP 200 and
  puts the real outcome in ``meta.statuscode``, where success is ``100``.
  ``/ocs/v2.php`` mirrors the OCS code onto the HTTP status and uses ``200``.
  Both codes therefore mean success, depending only on which route was called.

* **997 is not a server error.** Nextcloud returns it when the request was
  unauthenticated *or* when it omitted the mandatory ``OCS-APIRequest: true``
  header that its CSRF check requires on every OCS call. Reported as a generic
  failure it sends the reader hunting for a server fault that is not there, so
  it gets named explicitly here.

This module deliberately does **not** raise. Three clients parse this envelope
and each raises a different type that its callers already catch --
``OCSError`` (collectives, caught in a dozen places in ``server/collectives``),
``HTTPStatusError`` (mail), and ``RuntimeError`` (sharing). Centralising the
*parsing* and the *wording* is safe; centralising the raising would change
three caller contracts at once.

#: Headers Nextcloud's CSRF check requires on every OCS request. Omitting
#: ``OCS-APIRequest`` yields ``meta.statuscode: 997``, not a 4xx, which is why
#: it is easy to misdiagnose.
#:
#: Used by every client that calls an ``/ocs/v2.php`` route: sharing,
#: collectives, mail, deck, groups, tables, users, talk, and the two
#: capability lookups on ``NextcloudClient`` itself.
#:
#: Read-only on purpose. Nine clients share this one object, so an in-place
#: edit here would be a cross-client bug; ``MappingProxyType`` makes that a
#: ``TypeError`` at the point of the mistake rather than a comment asking
#: nicely. Every consumer already takes a ``dict(...)`` or ``{**...}`` copy,
#: which is now belt-and-braces rather than the only line of defence -- and if
#: those copies are ever unified into one idiom, this is what makes dropping
#: them safe.
#:
#: What this constant owns is the *pairing* -- ``OCS-APIRequest`` together with
#: ``Accept: application/json`` -- and ``tests/unit/test_ocs_headers_are_shared``
#: fails if any client outside this module spells that pairing itself. Header
#: dicts sending ``OCS-APIRequest`` alone are a different set and stay inline:
#:
#: * ``webdav`` sends it on DAV verbs, which Sabre answers in XML, so this
#:   constant's ``Accept`` would be a lie.
#: * ``MailClient.get_attachment`` downloads binary attachment bytes, which
#:   are likewise not JSON. (Deck's attachment download sends no headers at
#:   all, so it is not a third spelling of this pattern -- just another route
#:   that has no use for the pairing.)
#: * ``DeckClient._get_deck_headers`` serves Deck's own REST API rather than an
#:   ``/ocs/v2.php`` route, and sends ``Content-Type`` rather than ``Accept``.
#: * ``api/passwords.py`` asks for JSON with the ``format=json`` query
#:   parameter, which OCS honours in place of the header. Also correct -- do
#:   not "fix" it by adding the pairing.
