"""Surface the explanation Nextcloud's DAV layer already sends on a failure.

Sabre/DAV answers a failed request with a document naming the concrete cause::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <d:error xmlns:d="DAV:" xmlns:s="http://sabredav.org/ns">
      <s:exception>Sabre\\DAV\\Exception\\Locked</s:exception>
      <s:message>File is currently write locked</s:message>
    </d:error>

The status alone under-specifies the cause: a bare ``412`` says nothing about
*which* precondition failed, and a ``403`` can be a share permission, a blocked
filename, or a quota rule. Discarding that body is the difference between an
actionable error and a shrug -- an unfiltered WebDAV SEARCH returning ``500``
took far longer to diagnose than it should have, because the server was saying
``TypeError`` in a body nobody read.

Three statuses get their own type because callers branch on them:

===  ==============================  =======================================
412  :class:`DavPreconditionFailed`  ``If-Match`` ETag no longer current
423  :class:`DavLocked`              resource write-locked by another client
507  :class:`DavInsufficientStorage` quota exhausted
===  ==============================  =======================================

Everything here derives from :class:`httpx.HTTPStatusError`, so handlers that
predate this module keep catching these unchanged.

Both of ``BaseNextcloudClient``'s request paths are wired to this: the buffered
``_make_request`` and the streaming ``_stream_request``. The streaming one
raises before its body is read, so it gets the status-based type without the
server's wording -- a 507 download is still a
:class:`DavInsufficientStorage`.
