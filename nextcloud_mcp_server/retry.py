"""Shared transient-error retry helper.

One capped exponential-backoff loop, used by anything that needs to ride out a
transient failure: the embedding providers (429 rate limits, plus connection
drops / timeouts / 5xx for the embedding path) and the startup dependency probes
(OIDC discovery, Qdrant collection init). The ``should_retry`` predicate decides
which caught exceptions are transient; everything else propagates immediately.

``jitter=True`` adds full jitter (``uniform(0, delay)``) on top of the capped
exponential curve, which is what the startup probes want — without it, every
replica in a deployment retries a briefly-unreachable dependency in lockstep.

Not every retry loop in this codebase belongs here, and the ones that stayed
put did so for a reason:

- ``BaseNextcloudClient._stream_request`` — a partially-consumed stream cannot
  be replayed, and it meters every attempt on the API-call histogram.
- ``CalendarClient._wait_for_calendar`` — a poll-until-a-condition-holds loop.
  It retries a call that *succeeded* but hasn't converged yet, which an
  exception-driven decorator cannot express without inventing a sentinel.
- ``client_registration`` — inspects ``response.status_code`` directly and
  honours ``Retry-After`` as ``min(header, local_backoff)``. Expressing that
  would mean a hook parameter here serving exactly one caller.
- ``vector/processor`` indexing retry — its per-attempt log carries structured
  ``extra`` fields (doc_id, doc_type, attempt, status) that operators query on,
  and its exhausted branch derives a drop reason and emits two metrics. Neither
  is expressible through a generic decorator.

    Args:
        exception_type: Catch this exception class (or tuple of classes), e.g.
            ``openai.APIError`` or ``httpx.RequestError``.
        should_retry: Predicate that decides whether a caught exception is
            transient (and so retryable) vs. a permanent error of the same
            class. Defaults to "always True" — appropriate when
            ``exception_type`` is already transient-specific (e.g. a 429 class).
        provider_name: Used in log messages so operators can tell which caller
            exhausted retries.
        label: Short noun for the log message ("rate limit", "transient error")
            so the line accurately names what was retried.
        max_retries: Total attempts, including the first. Clamped to at least 1,
            so a caller threading a settings value through (where a validator
            may have been bypassed) still runs once instead of falling straight
            to the exhausted branch with nothing to raise.
        initial_delay: Delay before the second attempt, doubled thereafter.
        max_delay: Ceiling on every sleep, the first one included — so passing
            ``initial_delay`` greater than this clamps rather than overshoots.
        jitter: Sleep ``uniform(0, delay)`` rather than exactly ``delay``, so
            concurrent callers spread out instead of retrying in lockstep.
