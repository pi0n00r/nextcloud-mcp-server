"""Compact JSON in tool results (GH #1395).

MCPServer serialises every non-string tool return with ``indent=2``
(``mcp.server.mcpserver.utilities.func_metadata._convert_to_content``), and this
SDK exposes no serializer hook to override it -- neither does the v2
``mcpserver`` package, so migrating does not fix it either. The consumer is a
language model with a bounded context window, and that indentation costs
16-41% of every response while carrying no information.

Re-serialising the *finished content blocks* keeps the fix on our side of the
dependency boundary. Patching the SDK's private helper would silently stop
applying if it were renamed; content blocks are protocol types that both SDK
versions return, so this cannot fail quietly.
