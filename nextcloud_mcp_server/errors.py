"""LLM-friendly rendering of tool failures (GH #1208).

The MCP SDK funnels every tool exception through
``ToolError(f"Error executing tool {name}: {e}")`` and returns that string
verbatim as the error content, so an unhandled ``httpx`` error reaches the model
as an internal URL plus an MDN link and no hint about what to do next. Rewriting
that one string at the tool boundary fixes every tool at once -- see
:class:`NextcloudFastMCP`.
