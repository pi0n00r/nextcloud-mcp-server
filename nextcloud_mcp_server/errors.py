"""LLM-friendly rendering of tool failures (GH #1208).

The MCP SDK funnels every unanticipated tool exception into a ``ToolError`` and
returns its message as the error content. On mcp 1.x that message was
``f"Error executing tool {name}: {e}"``, so an unhandled ``httpx`` error reached
the model as an internal URL plus an MDN link and no hint about what to do next.
mcp 2.x withholds the original entirely -- ``UnexpectedToolError`` says only
``Error executing tool {name}`` -- which is less misleading and even less
actionable.

Either way the original is on ``__cause__``, so rewriting that one message at
the tool boundary fixes every tool at once -- see :class:`NextcloudMCPServer`.
