"""Content-addressed dead-letter markers for terminally-failed documents.

A document that fails its terminal extraction tier (a hard parse failure with no
higher tier to escalate to — e.g. the ``structured`` tier timing out while OCR is
disabled) must not be retried forever. The per-user placeholder ``status="failed"``
mark cannot stop the loop on its own: placeholder point IDs are user-agnostic
(``uuid5("file:<doc_id>:placeholder")``) but the scanner's freshness gate filters
by ``user_id``, so for a file visible to *several* users the single shared
placeholder's ``user_id`` is overwritten by whoever scanned last and every other
user's scan sees "no record → re-queue", re-burning the (failing) parse on a loop.

This module records a **durable, content-addressed, user-agnostic** dead-letter
marker instead. One marker point per document (a distinct deterministic ID, kept
separate from the in-flight placeholder), carrying the ``etag`` and an escalation
``tiers_sig`` (see ``document_processors.escalation.escalation_tiers_signature``).
The scanner consults it tenant-wide — for every user — and skips re-queuing while
BOTH still match, so the document is attempted once per content-version and never
loops. A content change (new ``etag``) or a config change that adds an escalation
tier (e.g. enabling OCR — new ``tiers_sig``) makes the marker stale and the
document retryable again.

The same marker point also tracks *non-terminal* failures (GH #1345). A parse
failure at the deepest tier is terminal on its first attempt, but an embedding /
Qdrant / transport failure is transient-until-proven-otherwise: parking a document
on the first one would drop every in-flight document during a backend outage. So
``record_index_failure`` counts **consecutive** such failures per content-version
in the marker's ``attempts`` field and only flips ``dead_letter`` to True once
``VECTOR_SYNC_MAX_INDEX_FAILURES`` is reached. Below that threshold the marker is
a *soft* one: ``dead_letter=False``, invisible to ``is_dead_lettered``, so the
scanner keeps retrying. A successful index (or a delete) clears the marker, which
is what makes the count consecutive rather than cumulative.

The marker carries ``is_placeholder=True`` so the existing search exclusion
(``get_placeholder_filter``) keeps it out of user-facing results with no extra
filter, plus ``dead_letter`` (True once terminal) so the orphan-placeholder sweep
and the scanner can tell it apart from a volatile in-flight placeholder. The sweep
keys off the *presence* of that field, not its value, so a soft marker is not
swept away mid-count.

Mirrors the fail-safe philosophy of ``sharing_state``: a Qdrant error never aborts
ingest — a failed lookup degrades to "process normally", a failed write is logged,
not raised.

TODO(deck-349): a marker for a file that is dead-lettered and *then* deleted from
Nextcloud can be orphaned. The processor's delete path clears it, but the
scanner's grace-period deletion tracking only sees a file via its real indexed
points (filtered by ``user_id``); a dead-lettered file has only this
user-agnostic marker, so its disappearance enqueues no delete task and the marker
is never reached. Not a correctness issue (search excludes ``is_placeholder=True``
and the etag check means a stale marker never blocks new content), but it
accumulates. A dedicated marker sweep or a TTL payload field would close it —
tracked as a follow-up, not done here.

    """Count one failed index attempt; dead-letter once the limit is reached.

    The GH #1345 path. Unlike a parse failure, an embed/Qdrant/transport failure
    is assumed transient at first — parking on the first one would drop every
    in-flight document during a backend outage. So the count is kept on the
    marker and the document is parked only at
    ``VECTOR_SYNC_MAX_INDEX_FAILURES``; below that the marker stays soft and the
    scanner keeps re-queuing, exactly as it did before this existed.

    The count is *consecutive*: a successful index or a delete clears the marker
    (``clear_dead_letter``), and a marker whose ``etag``/``tiers_sig`` no longer
    match is treated as a fresh start — new content deserves its own budget
    rather than inheriting the previous version's.

    Returns True when this failure parked the document (so the caller can record
    the dead-letter metric), False while it is still being retried. Fail-safe: a
    Qdrant read error counts the attempt as the first, which at worst delays
    parking — it never parks a document early.

    **A Qdrant outage cannot park anything**, and that is load-bearing rather
    than incidental: the counter lives in the very store whose availability it
    is judging, so while Qdrant is down both the read and the write here fail
    and the count cannot advance. Were it kept anywhere else, an outage longer
    than ``limit × VECTOR_SYNC_SCAN_INTERVAL`` would park every in-flight
    document, and they would stay parked until their etag changed — i.e. never,
    for a static corpus. Pinned by
    ``test_a_qdrant_outage_cannot_park_anything``; do not "fix" the swallowed
    errors into a fallback that keeps counting.

    Note the asymmetry: a *Qdrant* fault self-protects this way, but a sustained
    **embedding-backend** outage does not — Qdrant stays healthy, so the count
    advances normally and documents park after ``limit`` rounds. A failure that
    is genuinely per-document (an oversize payload, a chunk the backend always
    rejects) is exactly what parking is for; a backend-wide outage is not.
    Distinguishing them needs cross-document state this function does not have.

    The read-then-write is deliberately NOT compare-and-swap. Two concurrent
    failures for the same document can both read ``attempts=N`` and both write
    ``N+1``, undercounting by one — and that is reachable in normal operation,
    since a file shared by N users produces N tasks for the same ``doc_id``. The
    write is also last-write-wins on a deterministic point ID, so a straggling
    task holding a stale pre-terminal count can overwrite an already-terminal
    marker back to ``dead_letter=False`` shortly after it parked. Both land in
    the same safe direction — parking is delayed by a round, never triggered
    early — and the straggler's own next round re-parks it. Qdrant offers no
    payload-level CAS to close either with, and trading a lost round for that
    machinery is not worth it.

    Those two are delays. A third hazard was NOT, and is worth naming because it
    is the one that actually bit: the count only accumulates while nothing else
    clears the marker mid-round. ``_index_document`` used to call
    ``clear_dead_letter`` *before* its final Qdrant upsert, so a persistently
    failing upsert deleted its own count every round — ``attempts`` was rewritten
    to 1 forever and the document could never park. The clear now runs only after
    the upsert succeeds. Any future caller of ``clear_dead_letter`` on a path that
    can still fail afterwards reintroduces that bug.
