"""Shared read model for the vector-sync status surface (Deck #183).

The status endpoints (``/api/v1/vector-sync/status``, the userinfo route, and
the ``nc_get_vector_sync_status`` MCP tool) all need the same "how much work is
outstanding" figure, computed differently per ``INGEST_QUEUE`` backend:

- ``memory`` — the in-process anyio stream's buffer depth (today's behavior).
- ``postgres`` — procrastinate job counts read from the per-tenant Postgres
  (``todo`` + ``doing``), plus the per-status breakdown for observability.

``indexed_documents`` (the Qdrant placeholder count) is backend-independent and
stays at each call site.
