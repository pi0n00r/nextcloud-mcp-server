"""Procrastinate-backed ingest queue — the Postgres ``TaskProducer`` + worker
(Deck #183).

This replaces NATS JetStream and the old Postgres-queue stub. The MCP server now
owns *both* sides of ingest:

- **Producer** (API role / scanner) — :class:`ProcrastinateTaskProducer.send`
  *defers* one ``ingest:process_document`` job per changed document onto the
  cheapest tier's queue (``ingest-fast``) in the per-tenant Postgres (the same
  app DB; procrastinate manages its own tables).
- **Consumer** (worker role) — ``nextcloud-mcp-server worker [--tier T]`` runs
  :func:`procrastinate.App.run_worker`, which drains its tier's queue and invokes
  the existing :func:`process_document` pipeline. A parse too poor to index hops
  the job to the next tier's queue (see :class:`TieredEscalationStrategy`), so
  cheap CPU parsing and paid OCR run on independently-scaled fleets (Deck #323).

Design notes:

- **No execution ``lock``, only ``queueing_lock``.** procrastinate does NOT
  auto-reclaim ``doing`` jobs, so a per-doc execution lock would permanently
  deadlock a document if a worker crashed mid-job. The Qdrant upsert is
  idempotent (deterministic ``uuid5`` point IDs), so a concurrent/re-run is
  harmless; ``queueing_lock`` (partial-unique on ``status='todo'``) is enough to
  dedupe enqueues, and :func:`reclaim_stalled_ingest_jobs` re-queues jobs stranded
  in ``doing`` — both by a dead worker (heartbeat sweep) and by a live-worker strand
  where the job's own completion crashed (time-in-``doing`` backstop; see its
  docstring). That idempotent-re-run property is also what makes the backstop safe.
- procrastinate is Postgres-only and uses asyncio; ``anyio`` runs natively on the
  asyncio backend, so the worker can call the anyio-based pipeline directly.
- Tasks are defined on a :class:`procrastinate.Blueprint` so the connector is
  decoupled from the task registry: production binds a real
  :class:`PsycopgConnector`; unit tests bind ``testing.InMemoryConnector``.
