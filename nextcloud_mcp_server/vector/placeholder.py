"""Placeholder point management for Qdrant state tracking.

Placeholders are zero-vector points stored in Qdrant to track document processing
state. They prevent duplicate work by marking documents as "in-flight" during the
gap between scanner queuing and processor completion.

Architecture:
- Scanner writes placeholders when queuing documents for processing
- Processor deletes placeholders and writes real vectors after processing
- All user-facing queries filter out placeholders (is_placeholder: False)

Placeholders contain:
- Zero vectors (dimension from the embedding provider)
- is_placeholder: True flag (for filtering)
- status: "pending", "processing", "completed", "failed"
- modified_at, etag from source document
- queued_at timestamp

      NEWER content than what is indexed (or nothing is indexed yet), or
    - ``None`` when the document is not in Qdrant at all.

    Placeholder and chunk points have different deterministic ids
    (``…:placeholder`` vs ``…:chunk:<i>``), so they COEXIST — while a document is
    being re-indexed, and afterwards if a scan wrote a placeholder that no
    subsequent index cleared. This used to be one unfiltered
    ``scroll(..., limit=1)``, which has no ordering: which of the two came back
    was decided by point-id order, i.e. a per-document coin flip.

    That was load-bearing. The scanner checks ``is_placeholder`` BEFORE it
    compares ``index_mode``/``modified_at`` (``vector/scanner.py``), so a
    fully-indexed, unchanged document whose leftover placeholder happened to sort
    first was read as "still queued", went stale after
    ``vector_sync_scan_interval * 5``, and was re-queued — every cycle, forever.
    For OCR-tier documents that is a full re-OCR on the burst GPU each time.

    Resolved explicitly instead of by luck, and NOT simply "prefer the real
    point": while a genuinely newer version is in flight, the placeholder is the
    authoritative state, and returning the stale indexed point instead would make
    the scanner re-queue an already-queued document on every pass. So the
    placeholder wins only when it is strictly newer; at equal or older
    ``modified_at`` it is stale bookkeeping and the index answers. Leftovers are
    cleared by the next successful index or dedup claim, so nothing is written
    from this read path.
