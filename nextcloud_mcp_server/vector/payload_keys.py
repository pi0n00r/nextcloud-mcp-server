"""Qdrant payload-key constants + the shared point-ID namespace (design §2.2).

These names and the ``NAMESPACE`` UUID are a cross-implementation contract: the
external document-processor (astrolabe-cloud-website) computes identical chunk
point IDs and writes the same payload keys. Divergence in ``NAMESPACE`` would
break Qdrant upsert idempotency and duplicate chunks at the Phase 2 cutover, so
the literal is pinned by a fixture checked into both repos
(``tests/fixtures/namespace_uuid.txt``) and asserted equal in each repo's suite.

Even in the default local mode the MCP server writes these keys on upsert, so a
later migration to the external processor is friction-free (design §10.2).
