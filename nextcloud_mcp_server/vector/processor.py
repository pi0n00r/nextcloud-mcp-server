    Two metered dimensions (Deck #67), recorded independently:

    - ``tokens_embedded`` — the embedding request's token count, recorded for
      *every* embedded document. The same metric search records, so the meter
      bills embedding tokens whether they were incurred indexing a document or
      embedding a query.
    - ``pages_embedded`` — a charge for **parsing** (PDF page extraction / OCR),
      not a normalized content size. ``page_count`` is the real number of pages
      the document processor parsed. Text content (notes, deck cards, news
      items) is never parsed, carries no ``page_count``, and accrues **no**
      ``pages_embedded`` row — only ``tokens_embedded``. There is deliberately
      no chars/tokens-per-page constant: pages map 1:1 to parsed document pages
      (card #282).

    Best-effort and flag-gated: a metering failure is logged and never breaks
    indexing. ``chunk_count`` is the empty-batch no-op guard — a document that
    produced no chunks embedded nothing, so both events are skipped rather than
    writing zero-value rows. ``pages_embedded`` is additionally skipped when
    ``page_count`` is absent or not strictly positive — gating on the page count
    itself (not the ``doc_type``) keeps this correct if a future non-PDF parsed
    type starts reporting pages, and a malformed non-positive count meters as
    "no pages" rather than emitting a zero/negative billing row.

    Privacy note: ``user_id`` stays tenant-local — the CP rollup aggregates
    GROUP BY (day, metric) into ``usage_daily`` (no metadata column), so nothing
    here reaches Stripe; it is retained only to keep Deck #67's future per-user
    attribution derivable from the app DB without a re-migration.
