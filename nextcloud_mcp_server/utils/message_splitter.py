"""Split over-long messages into postable parts on natural boundaries.

Nextcloud caps a comment at ``IComment::MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`` (1000) characters.
Rather than truncating -- which silently corrupts an activity log while
reporting success -- this module cuts a message into parts that each fit, on the
most structural boundary available.

This is deliberately *not* :mod:`nextcloud_mcp_server.vector.document_chunker`.
That one is async, overlap-based (overlap would duplicate text into the comment
thread) and tuned for MB-scale RAG documents. Here we want a synchronous,
exact-slice split of a few kilobytes.

The boundary rules come from LangChain's ``RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter``,
which is already a dependency. It is used as a *cut-offset finder*: we take the
offsets it would split at and slice the original string ourselves, so every part
is an exact substring of the input. That keeps the round-trip exact -- LangChain
drops separators from the chunks it returns, which for an activity log would
quietly mangle the text.
