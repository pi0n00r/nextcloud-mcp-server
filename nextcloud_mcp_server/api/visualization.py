"""Visualization API endpoints for search and chunk context.

ADR-018: Provides REST API endpoints for the Nextcloud PHP app (management UI) to:
- Execute unified search with semantic/BM25/hybrid algorithms
- Execute vector search with PCA visualization coordinates
- Fetch chunk context with surrounding text

None of these read file content: chunk bboxes and page numbers come from the
Qdrant payload, and management UI rasterizes PDF pages in the browser from the copy
already in Nextcloud. See tests/unit/test_api_no_whole_file_reads.py.

All endpoints require OAuth bearer token authentication via UnifiedTokenVerifier.
