"""Reads what a Nextcloud instance advertises on its OCS capabilities endpoint.

Two consumers, one cached lookup of ``/ocs/v2.php/cloud/capabilities``:

**Admin-approved searchable sources.** The Astrolabe Nextcloud app advertises,
per user, which content sources an admin has approved for semantic search, under
``capabilities.astrolabe.semantic_search.enabled_doc_types``. This is the single
source of truth for admin consent: the search layer filters results to these
doc types, and the indexing layer (scanner + webhook ingest) skips everything
else.

**Per-tool capability gates.** ``@require_capability(app, min_version=...)``
marks an MCP tool as needing an upstream app to be present (and new enough) —
Nextcloud apps advertise themselves as ``capabilities.<app>.version``. A gated
tool is hidden from ``tools/list`` and refused by ``tools/call`` on instances
that cannot serve it, instead of the model discovering a 404 the hard way.

Fail-open throughout: if a capability block is absent (an older app that
predates the feature) or the OCS call fails, ``allowed_doc_types`` returns
``None`` meaning "no restriction" and a gate is treated as satisfied, so nothing
regresses on an instance we cannot interrogate. For ``allowed_doc_types``,
``None`` is distinct from an empty set, which means "the admin disabled every
source".
