"""Reads admin-approved searchable sources from the Astrolabe capability.

The Astrolabe Nextcloud app advertises, per user, which content sources an
admin has approved for semantic search, under
``capabilities.astrolabe.semantic_search.enabled_doc_types`` on the OCS
capabilities endpoint (``/ocs/v2.php/cloud/capabilities``). This is the single
source of truth for admin consent: the search layer filters results to these
doc types, and the indexing layer (scanner + webhook ingest) skips everything
else.

Fail-open for *availability*: if the capability block is absent (an older
Astrolabe that predates this feature) or the OCS call fails, ``allowed_doc_types``
returns ``None`` meaning "no restriction", so search keeps working. ``None`` is
distinct from an empty set, which means "the admin disabled every source".
