                  scanned one escalates to OCR when the server has OCR enabled.
                - ``"markdown"``: additionally reconstruct structure (headings,
                  tables) rather than returning a flat text layer. Costs a
                  second, slower parse and is bounded by a page ceiling. When it
                  cannot be honoured the response says so instead of pretending.
                - ``"raw"``: do not parse. Text files are decoded, anything else
                  comes back base64-encoded.

                Files no processor handles (plain text, JSON, archives) are

            ``ReadFileResponse``. Alongside ``path``/``content``/``content_type``/

              ``not_applicable``.
            - ``content_format``: ``markdown``, ``text`` or ``base64``.
            - ``parse_tier`` / ``parse_processor``: which extraction tier
              produced the content (``fast``, ``structured``, ``ocr``).
            - ``parse_notes``: **if this is non-empty, tell the user what
              degraded** (OCR unavailable, structure not reconstructed, size cap,
              parse failure) rather than presenting the content as the complete
              document.
            - ``etag``: pass this back into ``nc_webdav_write_file``'s
              ``if_match`` when writing this same path later, so a manual edit
              made elsewhere in the meantime (e.g. in the Nextcloud web UI) is
              detected as a conflict instead of silently overwritten.
            - ``url``: a link that opens the file in Nextcloud. Offer it when
              reporting on the file, and especially when ``parse_notes`` says
              the extraction degraded.
