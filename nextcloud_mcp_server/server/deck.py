    Deck caps a comment at 1000 characters, measured after trimming
    whitespace and counted in Unicode code points. Markdown and @-mentions
    are NOT expanded before that check, so what you pass is what is counted.

    Check the length before calling and pick `overflow` accordingly:

    - 1000 characters or fewer: call as-is. `overflow` is ignored.
    - Longer, and the text is meant to be read on the card (activity
      updates, run summaries, changelogs): pass overflow="split" up front
      rather than guessing a shorter message. The text is cut at markdown
      heading, then paragraph, then line, then sentence, then word
      boundaries -- never mid-word -- each part is prefixed "(i/N)", and
      parts 2..N are posted as replies to part 1 so the card shows one
      thread. @-mentions are never split across parts. At most 10 parts.
      Past that, write the content to a note (nc_notes_create_note) or a
      file (nc_webdav_write_file), attach it with deck_attach_note /
      deck_attach_file, and post a short pointer comment instead.
    - Longer, and you would rather shorten it yourself: leave the default
      overflow="error". Nothing is posted and the error states the exact
      overage.

    Splitting is not atomic. If a later part fails, the earlier parts stay
    posted and the error names their comment ids -- resume from there
    instead of re-sending the whole message, which would duplicate them.

    Supports @-mentions: "@alice", or @"alice smith" for ids with spaces.

    Args:
        card_id: The ID of the card to comment on
        message: The comment text (max 1000 characters unless
            overflow="split")
        parent_id: Optional ID of a parent comment to reply to. When
            splitting, part 1 replies to this comment and parts 2..N reply
            to part 1.
        overflow: What to do when the message exceeds 1000 characters.
            "error" (the default) posts nothing and explains the overage.
            "split" posts the message as multiple threaded comments.

    Returns:
        CardCommentResponse. For a single comment, `comment` is it, `parts`
        is null and `part_count` is 1. When split, `comment` is part 1,
        `parts` lists every posted part in order (parts[0] is part 1), and
        `part_count` is how many were posted.
