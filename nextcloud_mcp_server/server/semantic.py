        Search Nextcloud content across apps, indexed in Qdrant.

        Behavior depends on the server's SEARCH_MODE (ADR-030):
        - hybrid (default): Qdrant native hybrid search combining dense semantic
          vectors (conceptual similarity, natural language) and BM25 sparse
          vectors (precise keyword/acronym matching), fused in the database for
          optimal relevance.
        - keyword: BM25 sparse (full-text/keyword) search only. No dense
          embeddings are generated or queried, so the deployment needs no text-
          embedding endpoint (airgapped). The ``fusion`` arg is ignored and
          ``score`` is a raw BM25 score (unbounded), not a 0-1 fusion score.

        Requires VECTOR_SYNC_ENABLED=true in both modes. Supports indexing of
        notes, files, news items, deck cards, and mail messages.

        Args:
            query: Natural language or keyword search query
            limit: Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
            doc_types: Document types to search (e.g., ["note", "file", "deck_card", "news_item", "mail_message"]). None = search all indexed types (default)
            score_threshold: Minimum score (default: 0.0). In hybrid mode this is
                a normalized fusion score (0-1); in keyword mode it is a raw BM25
                score (unbounded), so a >0 threshold filters very differently.
            fusion: Fusion algorithm: "rrf" (Reciprocal Rank Fusion, default) or "dbsf" (Distribution-Based Score Fusion)
                   RRF: Good general-purpose fusion using reciprocal ranks
                   DBSF: Uses distribution-based normalization, may better balance different score ranges
                   Ignored when SEARCH_MODE=keyword (no fusion happens).
            include_context: Whether to expand results with surrounding context (default: False)
            context_chars: Number of characters to include before/after matched chunk (default: 300)
            modified_after: Only return documents whose last-modified time is at or after this
                instant. Accepts an RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 datetime (e.g. "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z";
                a naive datetime is treated as UTC) or Unix seconds. None = no lower bound
                (default).
            modified_before: Only return documents whose last-modified time is at or before this
                instant. Same formats as modified_after. None = no upper bound (default). Must be
                >= modified_after when both are supplied.
            path_prefix: Deprecated single-folder filter; prefer path_prefixes. Restrict to files
                under this folder/path (e.g. "/Projects/Reports"). Folded into path_prefixes.
            path_prefixes: Restrict to files under any of these folders/paths (OR-ed), e.g.
                ["/Projects/Reports", "/Shared/Specs"]. Matches the file_path of indexed files
                only — setting it implicitly limits results to files. None/empty = no path filter
                (default).

        Returns:
            SemanticSearchResponse with matching documents ranked by fusion scores.

            Verification fields (ADR-019 verify-on-read):
            - verified_chunk_count: chunk rows that passed access checks
              (sized in chunks; counted before trimming to ``limit``, so it
              can exceed ``len(results)`` when a doc has multiple matching
              chunks).
            - dropped_document_count: unique ``(doc_id, doc_type)`` pairs

        Semantic search with LLM-generated answer using MCP sampling.

        Retrieves relevant documents from indexed Nextcloud apps (notes, calendar, deck,
        files, contacts) using vector similarity search, then uses MCP sampling to request
        the client's LLM to generate a natural language answer based on the retrieved context.

        This tool combines the power of semantic search (finding relevant content across
        all your Nextcloud apps) with LLM generation (synthesizing that content into
        coherent answers). The generated answer includes citations to specific documents
        with their types, allowing users to verify claims and explore sources.

        The LLM generation happens client-side via MCP sampling. The MCP client
        controls which model is used, who pays for it, and whether to prompt the
        user for approval. This keeps the server simple (no LLM API keys needed)
        while giving users full control over their LLM interactions.

        Args:
            query: Natural language question to answer (e.g., "What are my Q1 objectives?" or "When is my next dentist appointment?")
            ctx: MCP context for session access
            limit: Maximum number of documents to retrieve (default: 5)
            score_threshold: Minimum relevance score. None (default) selects a
                mode-appropriate default: 0.7 in hybrid mode (tuned for normalized
                fusion scores) and 0.0 in keyword mode (raw BM25 scores are
                unbounded, so a 0.7 cutoff would drop most matches). Pass an
                explicit value (including 0.7) to override in either mode.
            max_answer_tokens: Maximum tokens for generated answer (default: 500)
            fusion: Fusion algorithm: "rrf" (Reciprocal Rank Fusion, default) or "dbsf" (Distribution-Based Score Fusion). Ignored when SEARCH_MODE=keyword.
            include_context: Whether to expand results with surrounding context (default: False)
            context_chars: Number of characters to include before/after matched chunk (default: 300)

        Returns:
            SamplingSearchResponse containing:
            - generated_answer: Natural language answer with citations
            - sources: List of documents with excerpts and relevance scores
            - model_used: Which model generated the answer
            - stop_reason: Why generation stopped

        Note: Requires MCP client to support sampling. If sampling is unavailable,
        the tool gracefully degrades to returning documents with an explanation.
        The client may prompt the user to approve the sampling request.

        Latency profile: For each note in the result page, this tool fetches
        the full note body via ``client.notes.get_note`` after upstream
        verify-on-read has already round-tripped to the same endpoint as a
        race guard (ADR-019). Expect one additional Nextcloud round-trip per
        note result; raising ``limit`` above the default of 5 amplifies this
        cost roughly linearly. File / news / deck results do not pay this
        cost — they reuse the verified excerpt.

        # Resolve the mode-appropriate default when the caller didn't specify
        # one. The 0.7 default is calibrated for normalized hybrid-fusion scores;

        # most/all matches — so default to 0.0 there. A None sentinel (rather than
