        Search Nextcloud content across apps, indexed in Qdrant.

        Qdrant native hybrid search combining dense semantic vectors (conceptual
        similarity, natural language) and BM25 sparse vectors (precise
        keyword/acronym matching), fused in the database for optimal relevance.
        Documents indexed keyword-only (``keyword-index`` tag) carry no dense
        vector and so contribute via the BM25 sparse side only. They appear in the
        same unified result set.

        Requires VECTOR_SYNC_ENABLED=true. Supports indexing of notes, files,
        news items, deck cards, and mail messages.

        Args:
            query: Natural language or keyword search query
            limit: Maximum number of results to return (default: 10)
            doc_types: Document types to search (e.g., ["note", "file", "deck_card", "news_item", "mail_message"]). None = search all indexed types (default)
            score_threshold: Minimum normalized fusion score (0-1).
            fusion: Fusion algorithm: "rrf" (Reciprocal Rank Fusion, default) or "dbsf" (Distribution-Based Score Fusion)
                   RRF: Good general-purpose fusion using reciprocal ranks
                   DBSF: Uses distribution-based normalization, may better balance different score ranges
            include_context: Whether to expand results with surrounding context (default: False)
            context_chars: Number of characters to include before/after matched chunk (default: 300)
            modified_after: Only return documents whose last-modified time is at or after this
                instant. Accepts an RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 datetime (e.g. "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                a naive datetime is treated as UTC) or Unix seconds. None = no lower bound
                (default).
            modified_before: Only return documents whose last-modified time is at or before this
                instant. Same formats as modified_after. None = no upper bound (default). Must be
                >= modified_after when both are supplied.
            path_prefix: Deprecated single-folder filter. Prefer path_prefixes. Restrict to files
                under this folder/path (e.g. "/Projects/Reports"). Folded into path_prefixes.
            path_prefixes: Restrict to files under any of these folders/paths (OR-ed), e.g.
                ["/Projects/Reports", "/Shared/Specs"]. Matches the file_path of indexed files
                only — setting it implicitly limits results to files. None/empty = no path filter
