Prometheus metrics for the Nextcloud MCP Server.

This module defines all Prometheus metrics for monitoring server health, performance,
and resource usage. Metrics are organized by category:

- HTTP Server Metrics (RED: Rate, Errors, Duration)
- MCP Tool Metrics (per-tool invocation tracking)
- MCP Resource Metrics
- Nextcloud API Client Metrics
- OAuth Flow Metrics
- Vector Sync Metrics (conditional on feature flag)
- Database Operation Metrics
- External Dependency Health Metrics
