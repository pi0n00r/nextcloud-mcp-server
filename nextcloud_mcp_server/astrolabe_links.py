"""Deep links into the Astrolabe Nextcloud app's UI.

The Astrolabe frontend opens its chunk viewer from query parameters on the app
root (``src/App.vue``'s ``handleUrlParameters``), and strips them via
``history.replaceState`` once the viewer is open. This module is the only place
that *builds* such a link; the parser has existed for far longer than any
generator.
