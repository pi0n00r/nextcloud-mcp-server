"""Subprocess isolation for PDF parsing.

PDF text/markdown extraction (pymupdf + pymupdf4llm) is CPU-bound C code that can
balloon memory or hang on a pathological document -- e.g. a page with ~1M vector
path items drives pymupdf4llm's table detection past the pod memory limit and
OOM-kills the whole process. Running the parse in a worker *subprocess* (via
``anyio.to_process``) with an address-space rlimit and a wall-clock timeout means
one bad file fails *that document*, not the pod: an rlimit breach raises
``MemoryError`` in the worker, a hang is killed when the timeout cancels the call.

The worker function is module-level (picklable) so ``anyio.to_process`` can run it
in its process pool.

    #   itself -- which is how a healthy document dead-letters (Deck #911).

    #   Input: image_features", failing the parse. It is content-dependent, so
    #   PDFs fail unpredictably rather than consistently. Raising the cap is not
    #   an option; capping memory is why this worker exists (the OOM hotfix).
