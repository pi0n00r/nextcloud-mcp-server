"""Subprocess isolation for PDF parsing.

PDF text/markdown extraction (pymupdf + pymupdf4llm) is CPU-bound C code that can
balloon memory or hang on a pathological document -- e.g. a page with ~1M vector
path items drives pymupdf4llm's table detection past the pod memory limit and
OOM-kills the whole process. Running the parse in a worker *subprocess* (via
``anyio.to_process``) with an address-space rlimit and a wall-clock timeout means
one bad file fails *that document*, not the pod: an rlimit breach raises
``MemoryError`` in the worker, a hang is killed when the timeout cancels the call.

The worker function is module-level (picklable) so ``anyio.to_process`` can run it
in its process pool.

    #
    # * The import alone costs ~1157 MiB of address space (VmSize 34 -> 1191
    #   MiB) against our 1536 MiB RLIMIT_AS, leaving ~345 MiB for the parse
    #   itself. That is what surfaces as "Error during worker process
    #   initialization" classified as oom.
    # * Inference aborts under the same cap with "[ONNXRuntimeError] Missing
    #   Input: image_features", failing the parse. It is content-dependent, so
    #   PDFs fail unpredictably rather than consistently. Raising the cap is not
    #   an option; capping memory is why this worker exists (the OOM hotfix).
    # * Its chunks are ``defaultdict(lambda: None)``, and a local lambda as
    #   default_factory is unpicklable, so results cannot cross the
    #   anyio.to_process boundary back to the parent at all.
    # * It reconstructs from the visual layout, dropping text rendered outside
    #   the page box that the classic extractor kept.
    #
    # Two mechanisms, because they do different things. pymupdf4llm decides at

    #     try: import pymupdf.layout
    #     except ImportError: use_layout(False)
    #     else: use_layout(True)

    # import raise -- takes the classic branch and avoids the address-space cost
    # entirely (VmSize 499 MiB). The explicit use_layout(False) then still
    # disables inference if that block ever stops working (upstream renaming the
    # module, say); it cannot undo the import, hence both. Both are
    # worker-process-local and never affect the parent.
    #
    # Net effect: the extractor we were on before the bump -- plain picklable
    # dicts, ``metadata["page"]``, no ML inference in the ingest path. The exact
    # pin in pyproject.toml keeps that a fixed, known target. Adopting layout
    # mode later needs its own memory budget plus a re-check of the chunk type
    # and the metadata key; test_worker_disables_pymupdf4llm_layout_mode fails
