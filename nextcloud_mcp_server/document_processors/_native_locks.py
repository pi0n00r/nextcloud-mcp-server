"""Process-global serialization for the non-thread-safe native PDF libraries.

pypdfium2 (PDFium) and pymupdf (MuPDF) each keep process-global state — a single
library instance per process; pypdfium2 additionally mutates an *unlocked*
module-global object tracker on every object open/close. The ingest worker
offloads their CPU-bound work to the shared anyio thread pool, and once a tier
runs with ``concurrency > 1`` (or the ``ocr`` tier's existing ``concurrency:
24``), multiple jobs can drive the same native library from different threads at
once — a data race that segfaults or corrupts output.

These module-level ``threading.Lock``\\s serialize each library's native calls.
Two *separate* locks (the libraries are independent) let a PDFium parse and a
MuPDF bbox overlap across concurrent documents while forbidding same-library
concurrency. A ``threading.Lock`` (not an anyio ``CapacityLimiter``) is used
deliberately: some MuPDF work runs on the event loop (the escalation classifier's
``image_coverage_per_page``), not only in worker threads, so the primitive must
be acquirable from both — an async limiter cannot be awaited from sync-on-loop
code.

Observability: the wait to acquire each lock is recorded to
``bridgette_pdf_native_lock_wait_seconds{library=...}`` so lock contention under
concurrency is visible in Prometheus. The offload's *total* time already appears
in the enclosing OTel span (e.g. ``vector_sync.compute_chunk_bboxes``,
``document_processor.parse``), and each document keeps its own trace id, so
concurrent jobs stay attributable in traces/logs.
