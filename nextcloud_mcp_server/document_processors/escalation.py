"""Tier-escalation ladder + signal for the per-tier ingest fleet (Deck #323).

The escalation ladder is the cheapest-first ordering of extraction tiers:

    fast  ->  structured  ->  ocr   ( ->  llm, reserved)

It mirrors the ``tier`` vocabulary documented on
:meth:`DocumentProcessor.tier <.base.DocumentProcessor.tier>` and the
observability label set. On the *external* (procrastinate) ingest path each tier
runs on its own queue + worker fleet; a document that a tier cannot parse well --
or cannot parse at all (a hard timeout/OOM failure, #399) -- is **requeued onto
the next tier's queue** rather than dropped or escalated inline. The
mechanism is a raised :class:`EscalateError` that the procrastinate retry
strategy turns into a native ``RetryDecision(queue=<next-tier queue>)`` queue-hop
(see ``vector/queue/procrastinate.py``).

This module is deliberately free of any queue/transport dependency: it only
knows the *tier* vocabulary and the escalation signal. The tier -> queue-name
mapping lives in the queue layer, which imports :class:`EscalateError` from here
(document_processors never imports vector.queue, so there is no import cycle).

def escalation_tiers_signature(settings: Any) -> str:
    """A stable string fingerprint of the runtime escalation-tier configuration.

    Used by the document dead-letter marker (``vector/dead_letter.py``) as part of
    its content key: a document that fails its terminal tier is dead-lettered until
    either its content (etag) OR this signature changes. The signature therefore
    captures every setting that can make a *new* escalation tier become available
    at runtime — flip it and previously dead-lettered documents become retryable.

    Derived purely from settings (not the live ``ProcessorRegistry``) so it is
    identical across the API/scanner and worker roles: the *registered* processor
    set is build-constant, so the only runtime variables are the OCR-enabled gate
    (``document_ocr_enabled`` — the single OCR-tier toggle) and the tier-1 engine
    pin (``document_tier1_engine``). Enabling OCR changes the signature, so the
    pathological-but-OCR-recoverable documents dead-lettered while OCR was off are
    re-attempted automatically.

    ``document_max_pdf_size_mb`` is included for the same reason: an oversize PDF
    is always-terminal (``vector/processor.py`` never escalates ``oversize``), so
    without the cap here a document stays dead-lettered until its etag changes
    even after an operator allows bigger files -- and for an archive of scanned
    documents the etag never changes. Formatted with ``:g`` so ``50`` and ``50.0``
    fingerprint identically and a float-repr change cannot spuriously invalidate
    every dead letter.

    Note the blast radius: changing the cap invalidates ALL dead letters, not just
    oversize ones, so genuinely corrupt documents are re-attempted once too. That
    is the intended trade -- the alternative is a bespoke backfill path -- but it
    means a cap change is a thundering herd on a large tenant and should be rolled
    out one tenant at a time.

    ``document_markdown_max_pages`` is included for the same reason (Deck #399).
    A structured-tier ``timeout`` is terminal, and lowering the page ceiling makes
    a previously-timing-out document take the raw-text path and succeed -- so
    without the ceiling here it would stay dead-lettered until its etag changed,
    which for an archive of scanned documents never happens. Any change to the
    value invalidates dead letters, in either direction: raising it can also turn
    a text-only document back into a markdown parse. Formatted with ``:g`` for the
    same reason as the cap: a settings source that yields ``150.0`` instead of
    ``150`` must not change the fingerprint (and ``:d`` would raise on a float,
    breaking the dead-letter key for the whole tenant).

    TODO: when a future setting can make a previously-terminal document parseable,
    fold it in here so raising it auto-retries existing dead-letters. Known
    remaining candidate: a new escalation tier becoming toggleable (e.g. the
    reserved ``llm`` rung in ``TIER_LADDER``).
