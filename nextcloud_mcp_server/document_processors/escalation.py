"""Tier-escalation ladder + signal for the per-tier ingest fleet (Deck #323).

The escalation ladder is the cheapest-first ordering of extraction tiers:

    fast  ->  structured  ->  ocr   ( ->  llm, reserved)

It mirrors the ``tier`` vocabulary documented on
:meth:`DocumentProcessor.tier <.base.DocumentProcessor.tier>` and the
observability label set. On the *external* (procrastinate) ingest path each tier
runs on its own queue + worker fleet; a document that a tier cannot parse well is
**requeued onto the next tier's queue** rather than escalated inline. The
mechanism is a raised :class:`EscalateError` that the procrastinate retry
strategy turns into a native ``RetryDecision(queue=<next-tier queue>)`` queue-hop
(see ``vector/queue/procrastinate.py``).

This module is deliberately free of any queue/transport dependency: it only
knows the *tier* vocabulary and the escalation signal. The tier -> queue-name
mapping lives in the queue layer, which imports :class:`EscalateError` from here
(document_processors never imports vector.queue, so there is no import cycle).
