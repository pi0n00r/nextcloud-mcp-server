"""Tier-escalation ladder + signal for the per-tier ingest fleet (Deck #323).

The escalation ladder is the cheapest-first ordering of extraction tiers:

    fast  ->  structured  ->  ocr   ( ->  llm, reserved)

It mirrors the ``tier`` vocabulary documented on
:meth:`DocumentProcessor.tier <.base.DocumentProcessor.tier>` and the
observability label set. On the *external* (procrastinate) ingest path each tier
runs on its own queue + worker fleet; a document that a tier cannot parse well --
or cannot parse at all (a hard timeout/OOM failure, #399) -- is **requeued onto
the next tier's queue** rather than dropped or escalated inline. The
mechanism is a raised :class:`EscalateError` that the procrastinate retry
strategy turns into a native ``RetryDecision(queue=<next-tier queue>)`` queue-hop
(see ``vector/queue/procrastinate.py``).

This module is deliberately free of any queue/transport dependency: it only
knows the *tier* vocabulary and the escalation signal. The tier -> queue-name
mapping lives in the queue layer, which imports :class:`EscalateError` from here
(document_processors never imports vector.queue, so there is no import cycle).

    Used by the document dead-letter marker (``vector/dead_letter.py``) as part of
    its content key: a document that fails its terminal tier is dead-lettered until
    either its content (etag) OR this signature changes. The signature therefore
    captures every setting that can make a *new* escalation tier become available
    at runtime — flip it and previously dead-lettered documents become retryable.

    Derived purely from settings (not the live ``ProcessorRegistry``) so it is
    identical across the API/scanner and worker roles: the *registered* processor
    set is build-constant, so the only runtime variables are the OCR-enabled gate
    (``document_ocr_enabled`` — the single OCR-tier toggle) and the tier-1 engine
    pin (``document_tier1_engine``). Enabling OCR changes the signature, so the
    pathological-but-OCR-recoverable documents dead-lettered while OCR was off are
    re-attempted automatically.

    TODO: when a future setting can make a previously-terminal document parseable,
    fold it in here so raising it auto-retries existing dead-letters. Two known
    candidates: a new escalation tier becoming toggleable (e.g. the reserved
    ``llm`` rung in ``TIER_LADDER``), and a raised oversize cap (an oversize PDF is
    always-terminal, so without the cap in this signature it stays dead-lettered
    until its etag changes even after an operator allows bigger files).
