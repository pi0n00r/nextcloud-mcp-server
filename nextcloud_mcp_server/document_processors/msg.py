"""Outlook ``.msg`` messages, formatted for indexing.

The container is read by :mod:`._msg_reader`, a small olefile-based reader --
see its module docstring for why that exists rather than ``extract-msg``. This
module only turns the fields it returns into indexable markdown.

Every off-the-shelf option was measured on a real 1.3 MB thread and rejected:

* markitdown emitted **27 bytes** -- the literal string ``# Email Message\\n\\n##
  Content``. It looks for a body variant that message does not carry, while the
  same message holds a 14,996-byte body in the other one.
* docling-serve returned ``status=skipped``.
* LibreOffice cannot open ``.msg`` at all.
* unstructured recovered the body, but took 22.4s.
* ``extract-msg`` worked (15,303 characters in 0.15s) but pulls in
  ``red-black-tree-mod``, which PyPI publishes as an sdist only -- see
  :mod:`._msg_reader`.

The reader in ._msg_reader recovers 15,313 characters from that thread in
0.02s, so nothing was given up by writing it.
