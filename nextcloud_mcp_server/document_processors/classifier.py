"""Tier-0 document classifier.

Decides which extraction tier a PDF should escalate to, from cheap signals:
  * text_quality -- is the text layer usable, or mashed/space-less junk? (the
    "Student 147" lesson: a text layer can exist yet be unusable, e.g.
    "01322234567mobile")
  * no text layer -- the strongest OCR signal available from text alone.

Routing is on the TEXT signals only: a page escalates to OCR when its text is
near-empty or junk-quality. ``image_coverage`` is computed but is a DIAGNOSTIC
signal (the ``image_heavy`` flag), NOT a routing trigger: a mostly-raster page
whose embedded text is already usable (a scan carrying a clean OCR layer, or a
digital page dominated by a figure) gains nothing from re-OCR, so escalating it
to the paid OCR tier was wasteful -- on OHR-Bench the coverage trigger drove
~45% of escalations. The trade-off: image-only content on an otherwise-clean
page (handwriting, stamps, figure text) is no longer force-routed to OCR.

Two entry points:
  * ``classify_from_text(text, page_boundaries, ...)`` -- the HOT PATH. Routes on
    text-quality + near-empty pages derived from the tier-1 extraction (~no
    cost). When OCR + scan-detection are enabled the registry also passes
    per-page ``image_coverage`` (from ``image_coverage_per_page``) for the
    ``image_heavy`` diagnostic flag; that image pass is the only added cost and
    only OCR-opted-in tenants pay it. Thresholds come from per-tenant settings.
  * ``classify_pdf(content)`` -- a standalone/diagnostic pass that re-opens the
    PDF and does image-coverage analysis inline. Off the hot path.

Recommended tier:
  * ``ocr``  -- scanned / no-usable-text-layer (route to tier 3, when enabled)
  * ``fast`` -- a usable digital text layer (stay on tier 1)

``structured`` (tier 2 / docling) is a separate service, not produced here.
