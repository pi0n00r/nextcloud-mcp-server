"""Regression guards for card #1230 — empty document payloads.

A document that downloads to zero bytes used to travel all the way to the
embedding gateway, which rejected the batch OCR submission with HTTP 422
``"document decodes to empty bytes"``. 422 is permanent, so the document was
dead-lettered under the generic ``error`` reason and the loss was invisible
outside one dashboard panel.

Two guards close it, and both are pinned here: the ingest path refuses an empty
download before any tier parses it, and the OCR processor refuses an empty
payload before any gateway round-trip — whichever caller handed it the bytes.
