"""Unit tests for the ingest transport port (ADR-028; Deck #196).

Covers the factory's backend selection and each adapter's contract. The
single-tenant parallelism invariant (cross-user overlap) has its own follow-up
(Deck #197); here we only assert that ``LocalTransport.run_consumers`` starts the
requested number of workers off the shared stream.
