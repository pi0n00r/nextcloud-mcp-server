"""Tool failures must reach the model as tool results, not protocol errors.

This is the single behaviour most at risk in the mcp 1.x -> 2.x port. In 1.x the
SDK turned *every* exception out of a tool into ``CallToolResult(is_error=True)``,
so the model read the message and could react. 2.x carves out ``MCPError``: it is
passed through as a top-level JSON-RPC error, which the client *raises* — the
model never sees it. Roughly 140 raise sites in this codebase are
argument-and-state failures ("Note 5 not found", "Nextcloud access not
provisioned") that must keep landing in the result.

``NextcloudMCPServer.call_tool`` maps ``MCPError`` back to ``ToolError`` for
exactly this reason. These tests pin that from the *client* side, over a real
``Client(server)`` connection (which negotiates 2026-07-28), because that is the
only vantage point where "raised at the caller" and "returned as content" differ.
