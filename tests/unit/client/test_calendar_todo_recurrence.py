"""Unit tests for client-side VTODO recurrence expansion.

CalDAV hands back the whole resource but never expands VTODO recurrences, and
the master component's DTSTART/DUE describe the *first* instance. Without
expansion a monthly chore created in 2024 is reported as due 2024-02-03
forever, which reads as "years overdue" to any consumer.

Clients that materialise recurrences (jtx Board via DAVx5) write one
RECURRENCE-ID override per instance and mark finished ones COMPLETED, so the
unfinished backlog is recoverable from the resource. These tests pin that it is
recovered, and that it survives the Pydantic mapping the server layer performs.
