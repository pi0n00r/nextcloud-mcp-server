"""Guard against shell metacharacters in MCP tool descriptions.

Anti-injection MCP gateways (e.g. IBM mcp-context-forge) refuse to expose a tool
whose description contains shell metacharacters. The tool is silently dropped
from ``tools/list``: the server starts fine, the gateway reports no error, and
the tool simply never reaches the client.

Semicolons used as ordinary English punctuation are enough to trigger this. See
https://github.com/cbcoutinho/nextcloud-mcp-server/issues/1183, where 29 of 162
tools were dropped this way -- including ``nc_webdav_read_file``, without which
the server has little use.

Because docstrings are the descriptions, this is a documentation-style rule and
a static check over the source is enough: it needs no Nextcloud instance.
