"""Consumer contract: nextcloud-mcp-server -> embedding-gateway GET /v1/models.

:meth:`GatewayProvider._detect_dimension` reads the gateway's model catalogue at
startup to size the Qdrant collection, because the gateway is the authority on the
dimensions of the models it serves (``mistral-embed`` is not an OpenAI model, so the
OpenAI-wire base class cannot know its size statically).

This pact pins the shape that lookup depends on: a ``data`` array of objects with an
``id`` and — for embedding models — an integer ``dimension``.

**Why this pact exists now (astrolabe-cloud-website, Deck #931).** The gateway merged
its rerank catalogue into this same endpoint and removed ``GET /v1/rerank/models``, so
``/v1/models`` now returns entries that carry NO ``dimension`` (a cross-encoder emits
a score, not a vector) alongside the embedding entries this client wants. That is a
response-shape change to a surface we consume, and nothing pinned it before.

The interaction therefore deliberately includes a rerank entry the consumer must
*skip*, so verification exercises a mixed catalogue rather than a uniform one.
``_detect_dimension`` tolerates it by matching on ``id`` and reading
``entry.get("dimension")`` behind an ``isinstance(dim, int)`` guard.

**What this pact does and does not guarantee.** Pact matches objects leniently — extra
keys in the actual response are allowed, which is what makes contracts additive-safe.
Verified empirically: a provider emitting ``dimension: 0`` on the rerank entry still
passes this pact. So the *omission* of ``dimension`` for a scoring model is NOT
enforced here; it is enforced provider-side by
``test_models_route.py::test_rerank_models_omit_dimension_entirely`` in
astrolabe-cloud-website. What this pact does pin is the part the consumer genuinely
depends on: ``data`` is a list, entries carry ``id``, and an embedding entry carries
an integer ``dimension``.

The gateway is unauthenticated today, so no bearer is sent. See ADR-029.

# NOTE — deliberately ONE interaction. The obvious second case ("the configured model

# request is byte-identical and the gateway's response under this provider state is
# the same either way, so expressing it as a pact would mean two interactions sharing
# one state while declaring different `data` array lengths — which fails verification,
# since pact compares array length strictly. That behaviour is already covered a tier
# down by tests/unit/providers/test_gateway_provider.py::test_detect_dimension_model_absent
# (alongside the http-error and already-known paths). Contracts pin what crosses the
# wire; how this client reacts to it is its own business.
