"""Contract: management UI -> nextcloud-mcp-server ``GET /api/v1/status``.

For the status endpoint the roles are reversed from the other contract tests in
this package: **the management client is the consumer** and
**nextcloud-mcp-server is the provider**. The management UI reads
``supported_search_types`` from ``/api/v1/status`` to gate which query types it
offers (ADR-031):

- vector sync enabled  → ``["semantic", "bm25", "hybrid"]`` (the collection is
  always dense-capable; keyword-only documents contribute via the sparse side)
- vector sync disabled → ``[]``

This is **contract-first**: we author the pact the management client's UI will
implement against, pinning the field name, the value vocabulary, and the
provider-state strings. The matching server-side states are registered in
``test_mcp_provider_verification.py`` so the provider verification job honours
them once the management client publishes its real consumer pact.

The generated pact is written to ``provider_contracts/`` (NOT ``pacts/``) so the
``pact-broker publish tests/contract/pacts`` step never publishes it under *our*
consumer identity — the management client owns and publishes the real consumer
pact. The real provider response is verified by
``tests/unit/test_management_status_endpoint.py``
(``TestStatusEndpointSearchTypes``) and, in integration CI, by provider
verification against a running server.

See ADR-029 (contract architecture) and ADR-031 (per-document index mode).
