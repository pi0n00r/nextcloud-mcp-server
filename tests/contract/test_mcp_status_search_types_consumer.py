"""Contract: management UI -> nextcloud-mcp-server ``GET /api/v1/status``.

For the status endpoint the roles are reversed from the other contract tests in
this package: **the management client is the consumer** and **nextcloud-mcp-server is the
provider**. The management UI reads ``supported_search_types`` from
``/api/v1/status`` to gate which query types it offers (ADR-030):

- ``SEARCH_MODE=hybrid`` → ``["semantic", "bm25", "hybrid"]``
- ``SEARCH_MODE=keyword`` → ``["bm25"]`` (dense embeddings are off)
- vector sync disabled  → ``[]``

This is **contract-first**: we author the pact the management client's follow-up UI PR will
implement against, pinning the field name, the value vocabulary, and the
provider-state strings. The matching server-side states are registered in
``test_mcp_provider_verification.py`` so the provider verification job honours
them once the management client publishes its real consumer pact.

The generated pact is written to ``provider_contracts/`` (NOT ``pacts/``) so the
``pact-broker publish tests/contract/pacts`` step never publishes it under *our*
consumer identity — the management client owns and publishes the real consumer pact. The
real provider response is verified by ``tests/unit/test_management_status_endpoint.py``
(``TestStatusEndpointSearchTypes``) and, in integration CI, by provider
verification against a running server.

See ADR-029 (contract architecture) and ADR-030 (SEARCH_MODE).
