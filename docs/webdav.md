### WebDAV File System Access

The server provides complete file system access to your NextCloud instance, enabling you to:

- Browse any directory structure
- Read and write files of any type
- Create and delete directories
- Manage your NextCloud files directly through LLM interactions

**Usage Examples:**

```python
# List files in root directory
await nc_webdav_list_directory("")

# Browse a specific folder
await nc_webdav_list_directory("Documents/Reports")

# Read a text file
content = await nc_webdav_read_file("Documents/readme.txt")

# Read a document: extracted text by default, no base64
result = await nc_webdav_read_file("Documents/report.pdf")
result.content          # the document's text
result.parse_tier       # "fast" | "structured" | "ocr" -- what produced it
result.content_format   # "text" | "markdown" | "base64"
result.parse_notes      # non-empty => say what degraded; this is not the whole document

# Ask for structure (headings, tables) instead of a flat text layer
await nc_webdav_read_file("Documents/report.pdf", parse_document="markdown")

# Or take the file itself, unparsed
await nc_webdav_read_file("Documents/report.pdf", parse_document="raw")

# Create a new directory
await nc_webdav_create_directory("NewProject/docs")

# Write content to a file
await nc_webdav_write_file("NewProject/docs/notes.md", "# My Notes\n\nContent here...")

# Delete a file or directory
await nc_webdav_delete_resource("old_file.txt")

# Move or rename a file
await nc_webdav_move_resource("document.txt", "new_name.txt")

# Move a file to another directory
await nc_webdav_move_resource("document.txt", "Archive/document.txt")

# Move a directory
await nc_webdav_move_resource("Projects/OldProject", "Projects/NewProject")

# Copy a file
await nc_webdav_copy_resource("document.txt", "document_copy.txt")

# Copy a file to another directory
await nc_webdav_copy_resource("document.txt", "Backup/document.txt")

# Copy a directory
await nc_webdav_copy_resource("Projects/ProjectA", "Projects/ProjectA_Backup")
```

### File Comments

Comments annotate a file in place — review requests, hand-offs, context that
does not belong in the file itself. They are the same comments the Nextcloud
web UI shows in a file's sidebar.

```python
# Ask a colleague to review; @-mentioning them sends the notification
await nc_webdav_create_comment(
    "Reports/q3.pdf", 'numbers updated, please review @"alice"'
)

# Read the thread, newest first
await nc_webdav_list_comments("Reports/q3.pdf")

# Page through a long thread
await nc_webdav_list_comments("Reports/q3.pdf", limit=20, offset=20)
```

Mention a user by their Nextcloud user ID: `@alice`, or `@"user id with spaces"`.
Nextcloud parses the mention out of the message when it stores the comment and
sends the notification itself.

A comment is capped at **1000 characters** (measured after trimming whitespace,
counting Unicode code points — Nextcloud's own rule). Longer content belongs in
the file, with a short pointer comment.

### Safe Writes: Concurrent Edits and Locks

`nc_webdav_write_file` is **fail-closed** — it never silently overwrites an
existing file. Small writes use a conditional PUT. Writes above 1 MB retain
the fork's Nextcloud chunked-upload path and apply destination controls on the
final MOVE. The `if_match` argument selects one of three modes:

| `if_match`            | Behaviour |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| omitted (`None`)      | **Create-only.** Fails if the path already exists. |
| an `etag`             | **Safe overwrite.** Fails if the file changed since that etag was read. |
| `"*"`                 | **Explicit force.** Uses `If-Match: *` for a simple PUT and `Overwrite: T` for a chunked final MOVE. |

To change an existing file, read it first to obtain its `etag`
(`nc_webdav_read_file` returns one), then pass that `etag` back into the
write. If the file changed in the meantime (e.g. someone edited it directly
in the Nextcloud web UI), the write fails instead of clobbering their change.
`nc_webdav_list_directory` and the search/find tools also return an `etag`
per file, so you can obtain one without a full read.

```python
# Read, capture the etag, and write back safely
result = await nc_webdav_read_file("Documents/notes.md")
await nc_webdav_write_file(
    "Documents/notes.md", result["content"] + "\nMore.", if_match=result["etag"]
)
# Raises ToolError if the file changed since the read (etag mismatch, HTTP 412)
# or if it's locked by another client, e.g. open in the web editor (HTTP 423).

# Create a brand-new file (fails with ToolError if it already exists):
await nc_webdav_write_file("Documents/new.md", "# New")

# Deliberately replace an existing file wholesale, without reading it first:
await nc_webdav_write_file("Documents/notes.md", "# Regenerated", if_match="*")
```

> **Breaking change (0.x):** an `if_match`-less write over an *existing* file
> now fails with a `ToolError` rather than overwriting it (the previous
> last-write-wins behaviour). Pass the file's `etag`, or `if_match="*"` to
> force the overwrite.

For chunked uploads, RFC 4918 makes ordinary `If-Match` apply to the MOVE
source (`.file`), not its Destination. Create-only therefore uses
`Overwrite: F`; explicit force uses `Overwrite: T`. Exact destination-ETag
overwrite uses `Overwrite: T` plus a tagged WebDAV `If` condition naming the
absolute Destination URI. The condition is evaluated on the final MOVE, so the
update remains atomic without a preflight read or an unconditional fallback.

### Write Size Limit

`nc_webdav_write_file` builds its request from a single in-memory MCP tool
argument. The fork sends payloads above 1 MB through Nextcloud's chunked-upload
v2 protocol, but the complete argument is still resident in server memory. A
pre-flight size gate rejects content over `WEBDAV_WRITE_MAX_MB` (default 50,
`0` disables) with a clear error rather than risking a timeout or out-of-memory
failure.

## Conditional move and copy

`nc_webdav_move_resource` and `nc_webdav_copy_resource` accept an optional
`if_destination_match`. With `overwrite=True` alone the destination is replaced
unconditionally; supplying the destination's ETag replaces it **only if it is
still that exact version**, so a file someone else changed in the meantime is not
clobbered.

```python
info = await nc_webdav_read_file(path="Docs/report.txt")
await nc_webdav_move_resource(
    source_path="Drafts/report.txt",
    destination_path="Docs/report.txt",
    overwrite=True,
    if_destination_match=info["etag"],
)
```

### Why not `If-Match`?

`If-Match` applies to the **request-URI**, which for MOVE/COPY is the *source*.
Conditioning the destination requires RFC 4918 §10.4's tagged-list `If:` form,
which names the resource explicitly:

```
If: </remote.php/dav/files/user/Docs/report.txt> (["etag"])
```

### Limitations

Both come from sabre/dav and are surfaced rather than hidden:

- **Files only.** The etag is checked with `$node instanceof IFile`, so a
  **directory** destination always fails the condition with 412.
- **A missing destination yields 404, not 412.** An `If:` condition naming a URI
  that does not exist raises `NotFound` inside sabre. "The destination must
  exist" is therefore not expressible this way — `overwrite=False` already covers
  "must not exist".

`if_destination_match="*"` and combining it with `overwrite=False` both raise
`ValueError` at the client boundary rather than being silently reinterpreted.
