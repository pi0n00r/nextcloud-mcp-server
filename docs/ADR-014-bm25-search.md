# ADR-014: Replace Custom Keyword Search with BM25 Hybrid Search via Qdrant

**Date:** 2025-11-16

**Status:** Implemented

---

### 1. Context

Our RAG application currently employs two separate retrieval mechanisms:
1.  **Dense (Semantic) Search:** Using vector embeddings stored in our Qdrant database to find semantically similar context.
2.  **Keyword Search:** A custom-built fuzzy/character-based search to match-specific keywords, acronyms, and product codes that semantic search often misses.

This dual-system approach has several drawbacks:
* **Poor Relevance:** Our current keyword search is basic (e.g., `LIKE` queries or simple fuzzy matching). It is not as effective as modern full-text search algorithms like BM25.
* **Clunky Fusion:** We lack a robust, principled method to combine the results from the two systems. This leads to disjointed logic in the application layer and suboptimal context being passed to the LLM.
* **Architectural Complexity:** We must maintain two separate search pathways (one to Qdrant, one to the keyword search mechanism), increasing code complexity and maintenance overhead.

Our vector database, **Qdrant**, natively supports **hybrid search** by combining dense vectors with BM25-based **sparse vectors** in a single collection.

### 2. Decision

We will **deprecate and remove** the existing custom keyword/fuzzy search functionality.

We will **replace it by implementing native hybrid search within Qdrant**. This involves:
1.  **Modifying the Qdrant Collection:** Updating our collection to support a named sparse vector index configured for BM25.
2.  **Updating the Ingestion Pipeline:** For every document chunk, we will generate and upsert *both*:
    * Its **dense vector** (from our existing embedding model).
    * Its **sparse vector** (generated using a BM25-compatible model, e.g., `Qdrant/bm25` from `fastembed`).
3.  **Refactoring Retrieval Logic:** All retrieval calls will be consolidated into a single Qdrant query using the `query_points` endpoint. This query will use the `prefetch` parameter to execute both dense and sparse searches, and Qdrant's built-in **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** to automatically merge the results into a single, relevance-ranked list.
4.  **Backfilling:** A one-time migration script will be created to generate and add sparse vectors for all existing documents in the Qdrant collection.

### 3. Considered Options

#### Option 1: Native Qdrant Hybrid Search (Chosen)
* Use Qdrant's built-in sparse vector and RRF capabilities.
* **Pros:**
    * **Consolidated Architecture:** Manages both dense and sparse indexes in one database.
    * **No Data Sync Issues:** Updates are atomic. A single `upsert` updates both representations.
    * **Built-in Fusion:** RRF is handled natively and efficiently by the database.
    * **Superior Relevance:** Replaces our brittle custom search with the industry-standard BM25.
* **Cons:**
    * Requires a one-time data backfill which may be time-consuming.
    * Adds a new step (sparse vector generation) to the ingestion pipeline.

#### Option 2: External Full-Text Search (e.g., Elasticsearch)
* Keep Qdrant for dense search and add a separate Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster for BM25.
* **Pros:**
    * Provides a very powerful, dedicated full-text search engine.
* **Cons:**
    * **High Complexity:** Introduces a new, stateful service to deploy, manage, and scale.
    * **Data Sync Nightmare:** We would be responsible for ensuring that the document IDs and content in Qdrant and Elasticsearch are always perfectly synchronized. This is a major source of bugs.
    * **Manual Fusion:** The application would have to query both systems and perform RRF manually.

#### Option 3: Keep Current System
* Make no changes.
* **Pros:**
    * No engineering effort required.
* **Cons:**
    * Fails to address the known relevance and architectural problems.
    * Our RAG application's performance will remain suboptimal, especially for keyword-sensitive queries.

### 4. Rationale

**Option 1 is the clear winner.** It directly solves our primary problem (poor keyword matching) by adopting the industry-standard BM25.

Critically, it achieves this while **simplifying** our overall architecture, not complicating it. By leveraging features already present in our existing database (Qdrant), we avoid the massive operational and synchronization overhead of adding a second search system (Option 2).

This decision consolidates our retrieval logic, eliminates the data consistency problem, and moves the complex fusion logic (RRF) from the application layer into the database, where it can be performed more efficiently.

### 5. Consequences

**New Work:**
* **Ingestion:** The data ingestion pipeline must be updated to add the `fastembed` library (or similar), generate sparse vectors, and upsert them to the new named vector field in Qdrant.
* **Retrieval:** The application's retrieval service must be refactored to use the `query_points` endpoint with `prefetch` and `fusion=models.Fusion.RRF`.
* **Migration:** A one-time backfill script must be written and executed to add sparse vectors for all existing documents.
* **Infrastructure:** The Qdrant collection schema must be updated (or re-created) to add the `sparse_vectors_config`.

**Positive:**
* **Improved Accuracy:** Retrieval will be significantly more accurate, handling both semantic and keyword queries robustly.
* **Simplified Code:** The application's retrieval logic will be cleaner and simpler, with one endpoint instead of two.
* **Reduced Maintenance:** We will remove the custom fuzzy-search code, which is brittle and difficult to maintain.

**Negative:**
* The data backfill process will require careful management to avoid downtime.
* Ingestion time will slightly increase due to the extra step of sparse vector generation. This is considered a negligible trade-off for the gains in relevance.

### 7. Fusion Algorithm Options

**Update: 2025-11-16**

The BM25 hybrid search now supports two fusion algorithms for combining dense (semantic) and sparse (BM25) search results:

#### Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

**Default fusion method.** RRF is a widely-used, well-established algorithm that combines rankings from multiple retrieval systems using the reciprocal rank formula:

```
RRF(doc) = Σ 1/(k + rank_i(doc))
```

where `k` is a constant (typically 60) and `rank_i(doc)` is the rank of the document in retrieval system `i`.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **General-purpose**: Works well across diverse query types and document collections
- ✅ **Rank-based**: Focuses on relative rankings rather than absolute scores
- ✅ **Established**: Well-tested, documented, and understood in IR literature
- ✅ **Robust**: Less sensitive to score distribution differences between systems

**When to use RRF:**
- Default choice for most use cases
- When you have mixed query types (semantic + keyword)
- When retrieval systems have very different score ranges
- When you want predictable, well-understood behavior

#### Distribution-Based Score Fusion (DBSF)

**Alternative fusion method.** DBSF normalizes scores from each retrieval system using distribution statistics before combining them:

1. **Normalization**: For each query, calculates mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of scores
2. **Outlier handling**: Uses μ ± 3σ as normalization bounds
3. **Fusion**: Sums normalized scores across systems

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Score-aware**: Uses actual relevance scores, not just rankings
- ✅ **Statistical**: Normalizes based on score distribution properties
- ⚠️ **Experimental**: Newer algorithm, less battle-tested than RRF
- ⚠️ **Sensitive**: May behave differently depending on score distributions

**When to use DBSF:**
- When retrieval systems have vastly different score ranges that RRF doesn't balance well
- When you want to experiment with score-based (vs rank-based) fusion
- When statistical normalization better matches your use case
- For A/B testing against RRF to measure retrieval quality improvements

#### Configuration

Both fusion algorithms are exposed via the `fusion` parameter in MCP tools:

```python
# Use RRF (default)
response = await nc_semantic_search(
    query="async programming",
    fusion="rrf"  # Can be omitted, RRF is default
)

# Use DBSF
response = await nc_semantic_search(
    query="async programming",
    fusion="dbsf"
)
```

The `nc_semantic_search_answer` tool also supports the `fusion` parameter and passes it through to the underlying search.

#### Future: Configurable Weights

**Current limitation**: Neither RRF nor DBSF currently support per-system weights (e.g., 0.8 for semantic, 0.2 for BM25). This is a Qdrant platform limitation tracked in [qdrant/qdrant#6067](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/issues/6067).

When Qdrant adds weight support, the `fusion` parameter can be extended to accept weight configurations:

```python
# Hypothetical future API
response = await nc_semantic_search(
    query="async programming",
    fusion="rrf",
    fusion_weights={"dense": 0.7, "sparse": 0.3}  # Not yet implemented
)
```

**Recommendation**: Start with RRF (default). If you encounter cases where keyword matches are under- or over-weighted, experiment with DBSF. Monitor [qdrant/qdrant#6067](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/issues/6067) for configurable weight support.
