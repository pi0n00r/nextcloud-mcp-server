### Calendar Integration

The server provides comprehensive calendar integration through CalDAV, enabling you to:

- List all available calendars, including external read-only subscriptions
- Create, read, update, and delete calendar events  
- Handle recurring events with RRULE support
- Manage event reminders and notifications
- Support all-day and timed events
- Handle attendees and meeting invitations
- Organize events with categories and priorities

**Usage Examples:**

```python
# List available calendars. External subscriptions (webcal/ICS feeds) are
# included and reported with read_only=True and a `source` URL pointing at the
# upstream feed. Their events are readable through the normal event tools, but
# attempts to modify them will be rejected by Nextcloud.
calendars = await nc_calendar_list_calendars()

# Create a simple event
await nc_calendar_create_event(
    calendar_name="personal",
    title="Team Meeting", 
    start_datetime="2025-07-28T14:00:00",
    end_datetime="2025-07-28T15:00:00",
    description="Weekly team sync",
    location="Conference Room A"
)

# Create a recurring weekly meeting
await nc_calendar_create_event(
    calendar_name="work",
    title="Weekly Standup",
    start_datetime="2025-07-28T09:00:00", 
    end_datetime="2025-07-28T09:30:00",
    recurring=True,
    recurrence_rule="FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO"
)

# Quick meeting creation
await nc_calendar_create_meeting(
    title="Client Call",
    date="2025-07-28",
    time="15:00",
    duration_minutes=60,
    attendees="client@example.com,colleague@company.com"
)

# Get upcoming events  
events = await nc_calendar_get_upcoming_events(days_ahead=7)

# Advanced search - find all meetings with 5+ attendees lasting 2+ hours
long_meetings = await nc_calendar_list_events(
    calendar_name="",  # Search all calendars
    search_all_calendars=True,
    start_date="2025-07-01",
    end_date="2025-07-31", 
    min_attendees=5,
    min_duration_minutes=120,
    title_contains="meeting"
)

# Find availability for a 1-hour meeting with specific attendees
availability = await nc_calendar_find_availability(
    duration_minutes=60,
    attendees="sarah@company.com,mike@company.com",
    date_range_start="2025-07-28",
    date_range_end="2025-08-04",
    business_hours_only=True,
    exclude_weekends=True,
    preferred_times="09:00-12:00,14:00-17:00",
    timezone="Europe/Amsterdam",
)

# Bulk update all team meetings to new location
bulk_result = await nc_calendar_bulk_operations(
    operation="update",
    title_contains="team meeting",
    start_date="2025-08-01", 
    end_date="2025-08-31",
    new_location="Conference Room B",
    new_reminder_minutes=15
)

# Create a new project calendar
new_calendar = await nc_calendar_manage_calendar(
    action="create",
    calendar_name="project-alpha",
    display_name="Project Alpha Calendar",
    description="Calendar for Project Alpha team",
    color="#FF5722"
)
```

## Finding availability

`nc_calendar_find_availability` subtracts busy time from the windows you are
willing to meet in and returns what is left.

**Slots are maximal free windows, not a grid.** A free morning comes back once
as a single 09:00-12:00 slot of 180 minutes rather than as five overlapping
60-minute candidates. Pick any sub-range of at least `duration_minutes` from a
slot.

**Not everything on a calendar consumes time.** Ignored as busy:

- events marked free (`TRANSP:TRANSPARENT`);
- events on a calendar set to "never show me as busy"
  (`schedule-calendar-transp: transparent`, RFC 4791 5.2.9);
- cancelled events;
- all-day events only when you explicitly pass `include_all_day=False`.
  Opaque all-day entries block by default because they may represent leave,
  travel or conferences as well as birthdays and holiday feeds.

**Attendees are looked up for real.** Each address in `attendees` is resolved
through an RFC 6638 free/busy request to the scheduling outbox, and their busy
time is merged with yours. An attendee the server will not report on raises an
error rather than being quietly treated as free.

**The window.** `date_range_start` defaults to now and is never allowed into the
past; `date_range_end` defaults to a week later. The response reports the window
that was actually searched.

`timezone` (an IANA name) is the zone `business_hours_only` (09:00-17:00) and
`preferred_times` are expressed in. An unknown name is an **error**, not a
fallback -- business hours in the wrong zone are a confidently wrong answer.
Omitting it uses UTC. Name the IANA zone when business hours are local, so a
window crossing a daylight-saving change retains the correct wall clock.

`preferred_times`, when given, *replaces* business hours rather than narrowing
them -- so `preferred_times="19:00-21:00"` finds evening slots without also
having to unset `business_hours_only`. Overlapping ranges are merged (so the
same free time is never returned twice). Malformed entries are skipped when at
least one valid range remains; a wholly invalid constraint fails rather than
silently broadening back to business hours.

**A calendar that cannot be read is an error too.** If one of your calendars
fails to load during the search it is not skipped: it would contribute no busy
time and its booked hours would be offered as free. The same holds for an
attendee the server will not report free/busy for.

```python
availability = await nc_calendar_find_availability(
    duration_minutes=45,
    date_range_start="2025-07-28",
    date_range_end="2025-07-30",
    timezone="Europe/Amsterdam",
)
# -> {"available_slots": [{"start": "2025-07-28T09:00:00+02:00",
#                          "end":   "2025-07-28T11:00:00+02:00",
#                          "duration_minutes": 120,
#                          "date":  "2025-07-28"}, ...],
#     "duration_requested": 45,
#     "date_range_start": "2025-07-28T09:14:03+02:00",
#     "date_range_end":   "2025-07-30T23:59:59+02:00",
#     "attendees_checked": [],
#     "business_hours_only": true}
```

## Completing a todo

`nc_calendar_complete_todo` exists because RFC 5545 treats `STATUS`,
`PERCENT-COMPLETE` and `COMPLETED` as independent properties. Setting only
`status="COMPLETED"` via `nc_calendar_update_todo` leaves `PERCENT-COMPLETE` at
its previous value and writes no completion timestamp, so clients that surface
progress or completion dates disagree about whether the task is done.

```python
# Sets all three properties; `completed` defaults to now (UTC).
await nc_calendar_complete_todo(
    calendar_name="Personal",
    todo_uid="abc-123",
)

# Backdate the completion.
await nc_calendar_complete_todo(
    calendar_name="Personal",
    todo_uid="abc-123",
    completed="2026-01-01T09:00:00+00:00",
)
```

Not idempotent: a second call without an explicit `completed` restamps the
timestamp.

## Guarding a todo update against a concurrent change

`nc_calendar_update_todo` and `nc_calendar_complete_todo` both take an optional
`etag`. Pass the one you read the todo with and the write is refused if
anything changed in between, so a read-modify-write cycle cannot silently
discard someone else's edit.

```python
todos = await nc_calendar_list_todos(calendar_name="Personal")
todo = next(t for t in todos["todos"] if t["uid"] == "abc-123")

result = await nc_calendar_update_todo(
    calendar_name="Personal",
    todo_uid="abc-123",
    summary="Revised title",
    etag=todo["etag"],
)

# The write returns the next ETag, so a follow-up update stays guarded
# without re-reading.
await nc_calendar_update_todo(
    calendar_name="Personal",
    todo_uid="abc-123",
    priority=1,
    etag=result["etag"],
)
```

If the todo moved on, the call fails with a message naming the recovery —
re-read it, re-apply your change on the current copy, and retry. Omitting
`etag` still guards the instant inside the call itself, but not the window
since your read.

One caveat on chaining: `etag` comes back empty if the server sent no `ETag`
header on the write. Passing an empty value is the same as passing none, so a
chain built on it degrades to unguarded silently rather than failing. If a
write is worth guarding, check the returned `etag` is non-empty before
chaining it, and re-read with `nc_calendar_list_todos` if it is not.

On `nc_calendar_complete_todo` the `etag` is rarely wanted: marking a task done
is usually the intended outcome whatever else changed. It is offered so that a
caller who *does* want a guarded completion is not pushed back onto
`nc_calendar_update_todo` and its three-property footgun.

## Recurring todos

CalDAV does not expand VTODO recurrences: a `calendar-query` returns only the
master component, whose `DTSTART`/`DUE` describe the **first** instance of the
series. A chore created in 2023 that repeats every June therefore keeps
reporting `due: "2023-06-15"` forever, which reads as "three years overdue" even
though the current instance ran a few weeks ago.

`nc_calendar_list_todos` and `nc_calendar_search_todos` expand the recurrence
set client-side and describe the **unfinished backlog** of the series:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `recurring` | `true` when the todo has an `RRULE` |
| `recurrence_rule` | The RFC 5545 rule, e.g. `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=28` |
| `pending_count` | How many occurrences have started and are not done (`0` = up to date) |
| `oldest_pending_dtstart` / `oldest_pending_due` | The oldest unfinished occurrence — how far the backlog reaches back |
| `current_dtstart` / `current_due` | The most recent unfinished occurrence — the one to work on now |

An occurrence is **pending** when it has started (`DTSTART <= now`) and is not
done. Expansion applies `EXDATE` and `RECURRENCE-ID` overrides, which is what
makes per-instance completion visible: clients that materialise recurrences
(jtx Board via DAVx5, for one) write one override per instance and mark
finished ones `STATUS:COMPLETED`. `PERCENT-COMPLETE:100` counts as done too,
since some clients set only that. The result therefore matches the open items
such an app shows for the same series.

For a series with no overrides at all, every started occurrence counts as
pending — there is nothing recording that any of them were done.

**When judging whether a recurring todo is overdue, read `current_due` (or
`oldest_pending_due`), never `due`.** `dtstart`/`due` are deliberately left as
stored so that updates keep addressing the series rather than a single
instance.

Two bounds worth knowing: the backlog is searched over the last three years, so
`pending_count` is a lower bound for a long-abandoned series; and if the
recurrence cannot be resolved at all (no `DTSTART` to anchor the rule, or an
unexpandable rule) every field above is omitted rather than guessed.
