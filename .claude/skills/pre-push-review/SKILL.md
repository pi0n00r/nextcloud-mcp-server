# Pre-Push Review

## Purpose

Catch the issues that have repeatedly surfaced in PR reviews on this repo (#733–#750)
*before* the human reviewer or the automated `claude` PR-review bot sees them. Output is
a labelled punch list. The main loop decides what to fix.

This skill is calibrated to **this repo's recurring patterns** — not a generic code
review. The point is to short-circuit the review-round-N loop, not to replace human
judgment.

## When to Use

**Trigger when:**
- User says "review my work", "ready to push", "check before PR", "pre-push", or
  invokes `/pre-push-review`.
- After a substantive change (new module, new tool, refactor, behavior change) and
  before `git push`.
- Before opening or updating a PR.

**Skip when:**
- Tiny diffs (typo fix, README tweak, dependency bump only).
- User has explicitly said "just push it" / "skip the review".
- Branch is `master`, or has zero commits ahead of base **and** a clean working tree (`git status --short` empty).

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Establish scope (≤ 30s)

Determine the base branch and diff range. Default base is `master`.

```bash
git fetch origin master --quiet
BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/master)
git rev-list --count $BASE..HEAD                     # commits ahead
git diff --stat $BASE                                # files touched (incl. staged + unstaged)
git log --format="%h %s" $BASE..HEAD                 # commit list
git status --short                                   # surface uncommitted state
```

**Diff scope:** the review uses `git diff $BASE` (base → working tree), which includes
committed + staged + unstaged changes. This means in-progress work is reviewed too —
flag any findings against half-written code as such, and don't penalize obvious WIP
(missing tests, TODO stubs) the user clearly hasn't finished yet.

If the user names a different base (e.g. `main`, a stacked branch), use that instead.

**Identify the change shape** — these classifications drive scope-aware checks (Phase 3):

| Touches | Treat as |
|---|---|
| `nextcloud_mcp_server/auth/`, `*scope*`, `*token*`, `*verifier*` | **security-sensitive** (escalate B, J, K to blocking) |
| `nextcloud_mcp_server/server/*.py` (new `@mcp.tool`) | **MCP surface** (D4, I1 mandatory) |
| `nextcloud_mcp_server/client/*.py` | **client layer** (B1–B4, H1, retry/backoff) |
| `nextcloud_mcp_server/models/*.py` | **schema** (D1–D3, validators for PHP quirks) |
| `nextcloud_mcp_server/search/`, `nextcloud_mcp_server/vector/` | **vector subsystem** (E*, F3, latency budget) |
| Webhooks, `nextcloud_mcp_server/auth/webhook_*` | **webhook handler** (J3, J4, K1) |
| Tests only | **test scope** (skip A–E, run F1–F4) |
| Docs / ADR only | **docs scope** (run G3, G4 only) |

**Report up front:** branch, base, commits ahead, files changed, change shape.

### Phase 2 — Automated checks (in parallel, ≤ 30s)

Run these from the project root with separate `Bash` calls in **one message** so they
run concurrently:

```bash
uv run ruff check                                                    # lint
uv run ruff format --check                                           # formatting
uv run ty check -- nextcloud_mcp_server                              # types
uv run pytest -m unit -n auto -x --no-header -q                      # unit tests (marker, not dir)
```

If the diff touches `nextcloud_mcp_server/server/` or `tests/server/`, also run:

```bash
uv run pytest -m smoke -x --no-header -q
```

**If any automated check fails: stop and report.** Don't run the checklist on top of a
broken build — fixing the failures may eliminate findings or change the diff.

### Phase 3 — Read the diff and run the project checklist (2–5min)

```bash
git diff $BASE                                                        # full diff (incl. uncommitted)
git diff $BASE -- '*.py' | head -2000                                # python only, capped
```

Read the **whole diff** before composing findings. Cross-file patterns (test symmetry,
single-source-of-truth, deduplicated logic) are only visible in aggregate.

For each violation, capture:
- **Severity label** (🔴 / 🟡 / 🟢 — see Severity Guide below)
- **Category tag** (A1, B2, J3, etc.)
- **File:line** (new-side line number)
- **One-sentence note** — what's wrong, with a concrete fix direction

### Phase 4 — Output the punch list

Format follows the template in [§ Output Template](#output-template). Group by
severity. Include a brief **Strengths** section to balance the findings — this
matches the tone of the bot review on PRs #733–#747 and avoids the impression that
the review is purely negative.

**Hard rules:**
- Do **not** edit any files.
- Do **not** propose patches inline (one-line fix direction is OK; full code blocks are not).
- Do **not** repeat findings the linter or type checker already surfaces.
- If a finding is style-only and CLAUDE.md doesn't mandate it, demote to 🟢.

---

## Severity Guide

| Label | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **blocking** | Must fix before push. Real bug, security issue, or violates an ADR/CLAUDE.md mandate. | Cache-hit bypass on auth gate; raw `List[Dict]` from MCP tool; missing `await` on async call; HMAC compare with strings instead of bytes. |
| 🟡 **important** | Should fix. Not a bug today but a footgun that has caused review-rounds before. | Field description mismatches value; unbounded fan-out without semaphore; `int()` cast inside catch-all `except`; missing `open_world_hint=True`. |
| 🟢 **nit** | Polish. Not blocking, would be nice. | `Optional[X]` when surrounding file uses `X | None`; redundant regex anchors; missing test docstring; pluralization in error messages. |
| 💡 **suggestion** | Alternative approach to consider. No fix expected. | "Could use `frozenset` here for O(1) lookup"; "Could centralise this rewrite in `_make_request`". |
| 🎉 **praise** | Notable good pattern. Worth calling out for visibility. | Cache-hit AND cache-miss paths both enforce the gate; CI-guard test for registry exhaustiveness; explicit `*` keyword-only separator. |

**Escalation rules** (apply per change shape from Phase 1):
- Security-sensitive scope → all J* and K* findings are at least 🟡; auth bypass risks are 🔴.
- MCP surface → D4 (annotations) and I1 (response wrapping) are 🔴.
- Client layer → H1 (duplicate round-trips) is 🟡 minimum.

## Project Checklist

Each item is tagged for use in the punch list (e.g. `[B1]`). Items are mined from
PRs #733, #734, #735, #736, #737, #741, #745, #746, #747, #750.

### A. Style & typing (CLAUDE.md)

- **A1** — PEP 604 unions: `X | None`, never `Optional[X]`. (#737, #745, #735)
- **A2** — Lowercase generics: `dict[str, Any]`, `list[T]`, never `Dict`/`List`. (#736, #745)
- **A3** — `anyio` not `asyncio`: `anyio.create_task_group`, `anyio.Lock`, `anyio.run`. Flag any new `asyncio.gather`/`asyncio.Lock`/`asyncio.run`.
- **A4** — Lazy `%`-style logging: `logger.warning("msg %s", var)`, not f-strings, in any file touched on this branch. (memory: feedback_lazy_logging)
- **A5** — Typed signatures: every new/modified function has parameter and return type hints. (#733)
- **A6** — Stay consistent with surrounding file: if a touched file uses legacy `Dict`/`Optional`, flag the introduced inconsistency, not pre-existing debt. (#736, #735, #745)

### B. Error handling specificity

- **B1** — Hoist parsing/casts before network calls: `int()`, `json.loads()`, etc. in their own `try/except (TypeError, ValueError)` *before* the network call. Catch-all `except Exception` over the parse + network produces "unexpected error" instead of a specific log line. (#750-r3, #750-r5)
- **B2** — Narrow exception types: `except RuntimeError`, not bare `except Exception`, when only one failure mode is documented. (#750-r6)
- **B3** — Specific error messages with context: include the problematic value and its surrounding context (e.g. `f"expected int id for {doc_type}, got {type(value).__name__}: {value!r}"`), not opaque re-raises. (#750-r6)
- **B4** — Fail-open vs fail-closed is a deliberate choice: any new fail-open branch (transient error → keep going) needs a log line and a brief comment on *why* fail-open is correct here. (#750-r2)
- **B5** — Except clause order: when catching a subclass and superclass in the same `try`, the subclass must come first. `except TimeoutError` before `except Exception` (TimeoutError is OSError → Exception subtype). (#747)
- **B6** — Defensive parsing envelope: when extracting fields from external payloads, wrap in `try/except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError)` and return a sentinel. Bubbling `ValueError` from `int("not-a-number")` to the caller is a finding. (#747)

### C. Comment honesty & documentation

- **C1** — Comments must match behavior: don't say "background" if the code runs inline; don't say "evicts asynchronously" if it `await`s. (#750-r1)
- **C2** — Document all return-None / sentinel cases: if a function returns `None` for both 404 *and* malformed XML, the docstring must enumerate both. (#750-r6)
- **C3** — Cross-references point at canonical/earlier definition: "Mirrors `_verify_X`" should reference the function defined first. (#750-r1)
- **C4** — TODOs include WHY: `# TODO(perf): get_items(batch_size=-1) fetches all items at query time` ✓; `# TODO: optimize` ✗. (#750-r3)
- **C5** — Defensive code carries its reason: `.get(key, default)` that "shouldn't fire in practice" needs a comment saying so — otherwise readers treat it as load-bearing. (#750-r6)
- **C6** — Surprising-on-first-read code needs a one-liner: e.g. `password=token` for bearer auth is surprising; a `# caldav reuses the password slot for bearer tokens` line saves readers from suspecting copy-paste bugs. (#734)
- **C7** — Mark deliberate omissions: when a code path *intentionally* skips a guard (e.g. DELETE returns empty body, no shape guard), say so explicitly. Otherwise future maintainers will treat it as an oversight. (#736)

### D. API & type boundaries

- **D1** — Public response models narrow, internal types may widen: if `SearchResult.id: int | str` for forward-compat, `SemanticSearchResult.id: int` and convert at the boundary with an explicit cast that fails loudly. (#750-r3)
- **D2** — Field descriptions match the value: a field described as "unique documents" must hold a unique-document count, not a chunk count. Watch for `len(results)` assigned to a field whose docstring implies dedup. (#750-r1, #735)
- **D3** — Symmetry between related fields: `verified_count` and `dropped_count` should count at the same granularity. (#750-r6)
- **D4** — MCP tool annotations (ADR-017): tools that hit Nextcloud have `open_world_hint=True`. Read-only ops have `read_only_hint=True`. Destructive ops have `destructive_hint=True` + `idempotent_hint=True`. Create ops have `idempotent_hint=False`. Update ops have `idempotent_hint=False` (etag changes mean different inputs). (#741)
- **D5** — Keyword-only separators: use `*` in signatures with multiple optional params of the same/related types, e.g. `def __init__(self, *, password=None, token=None)` to prevent positional misuse. (#734)
- **D6** — Defaults match documented constraints: if the docstring says "max 1000 characters", add `Field(max_length=1000)` — don't rely on the server returning 400. (#737)
- **D7** — Create/update tools return `*Response` wrappers, not raw models: any new `@mcp.tool` returning a raw `BaseModel` (not `BaseResponse` subclass) is a finding. (#737, CLAUDE.md MCP Response Patterns)
- **D8** — Pagination metadata: a field called `total` should be the server-side total, not page count. Use `count` for "returned in this page" or add `has_more`. (#737)

### E. Concurrency, resource bounds & lifespan

- **E1** — Bound concurrency: any new `asyncio.gather` / task-group fan-out over user data needs an `anyio.Semaphore` cap (default 20 in this repo). (#750-r1)
- **E2** — Bound over-fetching: `limit * K` for filtering must have a fixed `K`. Unbounded N-types or unbounded `K` is a finding. (#750-r1)
- **E3** — Don't snapshot mutable singletons: `eviction_task_group` set during lifespan startup must be read via `@property`/accessor, not snapshotted into another object's `__init__` (order-sensitive race). (#750-r5)
- **E4** — Comment safety of dict/list mutation across tasks: when multiple concurrent tasks write distinct keys to a shared dict, add a one-line comment explaining cooperative-multitasking safety. (#750-r1)
- **E5** — Lifespan context symmetry: when adding fields to one of `AppContext` / `OAuthAppContext`, mirror them in the other to prevent silent regressions in OAuth mode. (#746)
- **E6** — Security gates apply on cache-hit AND cache-miss paths: an allowlist or scope check must run after both branches resolve. A test asserting cache-hit enforcement is mandatory. (#745)

### F. Tests

- **F1** — Symmetry across verifiers/handlers: if you added a 403 test for the notes verifier, add one for files/deck/news too. Asymmetric coverage in a registry-style module is a finding. (#750-r5, #741)
- **F2** — Fail-open paths have a test: any verifier or handler with a fail-open branch (non-numeric id, malformed payload) has a unit test that exercises it. (#750-r5, #750-r6)
- **F3** — CI guard tests for registries: registries (e.g. `INDEXED_DOC_TYPES → verifier`) should have a test that the registry is exhaustive. (#750-r2)
- **F4** — New public functions have tests: any new MCP tool, client method, or Pydantic model without a unit test is a 🟡 finding (or 🟢 if integration-only).
- **F5** — `caplog` is logger-scoped: prefer `caplog.set_level(logging.WARNING, logger="nextcloud_mcp_server.client.notes")` over plain `caplog.at_level("WARNING")` to avoid false positives from other loggers. (#736)
- **F6** — Wire-through tests at the right layer: pure-unit tests on the leaf class are great, but a test that the parent (`NextcloudClient.from_env`) actually threads the param through is a common gap. (#734)
- **F7** — Production-evidence regressions get a unit test: any bug found via CloudWatch / production logs (not in tests) needs a unit test added in the fix PR. (#746)
- **F8** — Test docstring consistency: if 4 of 5 new tests have docstrings, give the 5th one too. (#735)

### G. Configuration, docs & ADRs

- **G1** — New config knobs go through `Settings` + dynaconf validator: any new env var read directly via `os.getenv` in module code (rather than via `Settings`) is a finding. (#750-r5)
- **G2** — Resolve config lazily: `default = settings.X` at function-call time, not at decoration / module-import time, so test overrides work. (#750-r5)
- **G3** — User-facing docs cover non-obvious costs: new code paths with measurable latency (unbounded fetches, per-item round-trips) need a note in `docs/configuration.md` or the relevant ADR. (#750-r2, #750-r6)
- **G4** — ADRs match shipped interface: example code blocks in any modified ADR reflect the actual module's public API. If the ADR shows `Verifier` but the code ships `BatchVerifier`, the ADR is wrong. (#750-r3)
- **G5** — Tool docstrings document hidden round-trips: if an MCP tool now does an extra fetch per result (e.g. post-verification race guard), the docstring says so. (#750-r6)
- **G6** — Migration notes for breaking changes: a PR that silently changes failure modes (e.g. previously-allowed clients now get 401) needs a migration note in the PR description and ideally a startup log line. (#745)
- **G7** — Priority order in env var fallbacks: if a setting reads from `WEBHOOK_INTERNAL_URL` → `NEXTCLOUD_MCP_SERVER_URL` → `/.dockerenv` → localhost, document the order in code comments. (#747)

### H. Performance hygiene

- **H1** — No duplicate round-trips: if data needed by a verifier/handler is already in `SearchResult.metadata` or a passed-in object, don't re-scroll/re-fetch it. (#750-r1)
- **H2** — Single source of truth: hardcoded lists of doc types / scopes / app names in multiple files should reference one constant (e.g. `INDEXED_DOC_TYPES`). (#750-r2)
- **H3** — Limit clamping at the right layer: `min(max(1, limit), 200)` at the client layer gives a clear error rather than a confusing server-side mismatch. (#741)
- **H4** — Avoid empty JSON bodies in HTTP requests: `json=body or None` (instead of `json=body`) prevents sending `{}` and a spurious `Content-Type: application/json` header for bodyless calls. (#741)

### I. MCP response patterns (CLAUDE.md)

- **I1** — No raw `List[Dict]` from MCP tools: tools return Pydantic models inheriting from `BaseResponse`. MCPServer mangles raw lists into dicts with numeric string keys. **🔴 blocking when violated.**
- **I2** — Co-author trailer in commits: each AI-assisted commit ends with `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`. Missing trailer on AI-touched commits is a 🟢 note.

### J. Security & input validation

- **J1** — Validate untrusted identifiers before HTTP layer: room tokens, paths, IDs that go into URLs must be validated against an allowlist regex (e.g. `r"[A-Za-z0-9]+"` with `fullmatch`) *before* the request is built — not after. Path traversal (`../etc/passwd`) is the canonical example. (#741)
- **J2** — `hmac.compare_digest` on bytes: both sides encoded to `bytes` before comparison. Comparing strings is incorrect. (#747)
- **J3** — HTML-escape user-controlled values in HTML responses: even when the input is gated by an upstream check (e.g. `get_preset(preset_id)` returning `None` for unknown), escape on the success path too. Defense-in-depth, not single-layer. (#747)
- **J4** — Static-config-but-still-rendered fields should be escaped consistently: if dynamic fields are escaped and static fields aren't, the inconsistency itself is the smell. (#747)
- **J5** — Privacy defaults: defaults for polling/read-receipt parameters should minimize side effects (e.g. `no_status_update=True` for chat polling so users don't appear "online" on every poll). (#741)
- **J6** — Server-layer hardening even when client supports it: if an MCP tool calls a client with hardcoded safe values (e.g. `look_into_future=False`), don't expose the unsafe option as a tool parameter. (#741)
- **J7** — Redundant regex anchors with `fullmatch()`: `re.compile(r"^[A-Za-z0-9]+$").fullmatch(...)` — the `^`/`$` are redundant and misleading. Use `re.compile(r"[A-Za-z0-9]+")` with `fullmatch`. (#741)

### K. Trust boundaries

- **K1** — Comment where input comes from at trust boundaries: webhook payloads, request body fields, query params — say "user-controlled" or "static config" so future readers know the threat model. (#747)
- **K2** — Differentiate HTTP status codes by retry semantics: 503 for "try again" (queue saturated, dependency down), 500 for "broken" (genuine bug). 401 without `WWW-Authenticate` is correct when the caller has no auth state machine (e.g. Nextcloud webhook delivery). (#747)
- **K3** — Trust-boundary comments at API entrypoints: when a `uri` field in a request body is taken at face value (e.g. Astrolabe provides its own webhook URI), document the trust assumption. (#747)

### L. Sentinel values & PHP API quirks

- **L1** — `0` as a valid value vs `None` as "absent": fields like `lastReadMessage` or `expirationTimestamp` may use `0` for "no messages read" or "never expires". Don't truthy-test them. Document semantics in field docstrings. (#741)
- **L2** — PHP empty-array-as-list quirks: spreed and other PHP backends serialize empty objects as `[]`. Pydantic validators must coerce `[] → {}` for object-shaped fields and `[] → None` for nullable single-object fields. (#741)
- **L3** — `isinstance(value, (date, datetime))` is redundant: `datetime` is a subclass of `date`. Either drop `datetime` from the tuple, or distinguish behavior between the two. (#735)
- **L4** — Field description matches serialized form: a field documented as "ISO date format" but accepting `datetime` will serialize as `"2000-01-01T12:30:00"`, not `"2000-01-01"`. Either coerce to date or update the description. (#735)

### M. Defensive code patterns & symmetry

- **M1** — `getattr(obj, "field", None)` masks future typos: when an attribute is *expected* to exist post-fix, prefer direct access so a typo (`document_recieve_stream`) fails loudly. The defensive `getattr` is the right call only when the attribute is genuinely optional. (#746)
- **M2** — Both-credentials / multiple-mode case has explicit precedence: when two mutually-exclusive params can both be set, either raise `ValueError` or `logger.warning` — silent precedence is a footgun. (#734)
- **M3** — Defensive dict construction over passing `None`: `kwargs = {"password": password, "auth_type": "basic"} if password else {"auth_type": "bearer"}` — don't pass `None` into constructors that don't accept it. (#734)
- **M4** — Speculative defensive code without observed cause: if you add an unwrap for `[{...}] → {...}` "in case the API returns it", cite the version/route where it's been observed. Otherwise it silently masks contract changes. (#736)
- **M5** — Idempotency of URL/path transforms: `_resolve_url` should be safe to call twice. If it adds `/index.php` only when missing, document and test the idempotency. (#733)

## What NOT to Flag

- **Pre-existing technical debt** outside the diff. Note as 💡 if relevant, but don't list as a blocking finding.
- **Style violations the linter already catches.** ruff and ty are authoritative for what they cover. Manual style checklist is for things they don't cover (PEP 604 unions, lazy logging, `Optional` vs `|`).
- **Code formatting** — `ruff format --check` is the source of truth.
- **Bikeshed-tier preferences** (variable naming taste, line breaks, comment phrasing).
- **Anything you'd phrase as "I would have done it differently"** without a concrete repo-pattern violation.
- **Findings that duplicate the bot's previous review** if there's an open PR with one already (use `gh pr view --comments` to check).

If a category has zero applicable findings, omit it from the punch list. Don't pad.

[If any check failed, stop here and report. Otherwise continue.]

## Findings

### 🔴 Blocking (<count>)

1. **[J1]** `nextcloud_mcp_server/client/talk.py:42` — Token interpolated into
   URL before validation; path-traversal risk. Move `_validate_token(token)`
   above the `httpx.URL(...)` call.

### 🟡 Important (<count>)

1. **[D2]** `nextcloud_mcp_server/models/semantic.py:87` — `verified_count`
   description says "unique documents" but value is `len(verified_results)`
   (chunk count). Either reword or dedup the value.

2. **[F1]** `tests/unit/search/test_verification.py` — 403 tests exist for
   notes/deck verifiers but not for files/news. Add for symmetry.

### 🟢 Nits (<count>)

1. **[A1]** `nextcloud_mcp_server/server/deck.py:118` — `Optional[int]` →
   `int | None` per CLAUDE.md.

### 💡 Suggestions

1. `nextcloud_mcp_server/auth/client_registry.py` — Pre-existing legacy
   `Dict`/`Optional` typing throughout. If touching anyway, opportunity
   to modernize.

## Strengths

- 🎉 **[E6]** Allowlist enforced on both cache-hit and cache-miss paths in
  `verify_token_for_management_api`, with a dedicated test
  (`test_cache_hit_also_enforces_allowlist`). Exemplary security gate.
- 🎉 **[F3]** New `test_supported_doc_types_covers_indexed_types` enforces
  registry exhaustiveness — will catch any future doc_type added without a
  verifier.

## Notes

- 5 commits on branch; all have `Co-Authored-By` trailer ✓
- ADR-019 implementation checklist all marked [x] (G4 ✓)
```

## Notes for the Running Model

- Read the **whole diff** before composing the report. Cross-file patterns
  (F1 symmetry, H2 single-source-of-truth, E5 lifespan symmetry) are only
  visible in aggregate.
- Keep findings **specific and short**. One sentence each plus a fix direction.
  The point is to feed them back into the main loop for fixing, not to write
  a treatise.
- If an automated check fails, **stop and report** — don't run the checklist
  on top of a broken build.
- The checklist is calibrated to *this repo's* recurring review feedback. If
  the diff is in an unrelated area (CI config, random docs), most items won't
  apply — say so rather than padding.
- **Don't fix anything.** This skill reports; the main loop fixes. Even if a
  finding is a one-character change, leave it for the user to action.
- Use `gh pr view <PR#> --comments` (not `gh api`) when checking for prior bot
  reviews on an existing PR — see memory feedback_use_gh_pr.
